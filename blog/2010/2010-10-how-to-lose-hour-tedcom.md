If you like smart stuff you will love TED Talks. I have watched dozens of these over the last couple of years and have never been disappointed. I tend to focus on tech or UI related talks like anything from <a href="http://www.ted.com/speakers/hans_rosling.html">Hans Rosling</a> (he is a fantastic presenter, too):

Another one of my favorites is an <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/blaise_aguera.html">incredible demo</a> of some tech coming out of Microsoft, presented by Blaise Aguera y Arcas:  

 

There are also random ones that don’t seem to have as much of a point to them but are utterly hilarious, like <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/ze_frank_s_nerdcore_comedy.html">this presentation</a> by Ze Frank:  

 

Tip: <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks">browse the presentations</a> with the filters on the left to find some of the best talks. Enjoy.
