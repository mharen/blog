<p>I checked the tools <em>I use </em>and discovered this Easter egg in <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/Products/SQL_Compare/index.htm">SQL Compare</a> and <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/Products/SQL_Data_Compare/index.htm">Data Compare</a> (v7.1):</p>

Why would I want that? I love Redgate and they deserve to be paid for their software.
