title: 'Word Document Automation with .NET 4: New Doc From Template'
---


With all the Word automation stuff Iâ€™ve been working through, it was nice to find something easy today. I wanted to create a base template and use it to start my docs from. So I created the template in Word as usual and saved it as a .dotx. 

Then, to start new docs from this, just include it in the <code>.Add()</code> call:  <pre class="csharpcode">WordApp = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Application();

<span class="rem">// open the template as a new doc</span>
var Doc = WordApp.Documents.Add(**PathToTemplateFile**);</pre>


Easy does it.
