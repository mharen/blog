title: Why Twitter is Awesome
---

<p>I don’t understand Twitter—how it works, how it makes money, or anything. As a computer engineer, I marvel at how impressive it is in terms of scale. For example, they are now crunching <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/02/22/twitter-50-million-tweets/">50,000,000 tweets per day</a>. That’s incredible.</p>
<p>![chart-tweets-per-day3-e1266872028279.png](chart-tweets-per-day3-e1266872028279.png)</p>
<p>Volume doesn’t make it awesome, though. Most of those tweets are about what uninteresting people are eating, watching, etc. Here’s why it’s awesome: I am empowered to connect with people in otherwise unreachable places. This calls for some examples:</p>  <h4>Example 1: Microsoft</h4>
<p>I recently ranted a bit about Visual Studio 2010 RC crashes:</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>If you crash on me one more damn time, VS2010, I will drop kick you onto the roof of my building. I'm not even kidding. <a href="http://twitter.com/mharen/status/9607164906">9:58 PM Feb 24th</a></p>  
<p>It's official, VS2010 is getting taped to a ball and kicked onto the roof of my office tomorrow. Hope you're happy...(I warned you). <a href="http://twitter.com/mharen/status/9609708666">10:59 PM Feb 24th</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This brought a very nice reply from someone I’ve never heard of (@Pilchie):</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>@mharen: Are you using a touch screen? Seen <a href="http://bit.ly/dlT7ez">http://bit.ly/dlT7ez</a> ? <a href="http://twitter.com/Pilchie/status/9610121141">11:09 PM Feb 24th</a>&#160;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It turns out that @Pilchie is “Dev Lead for C# IntelliSense/Refactoring/etc at Microsoft”. Well how about that? In a mere 10 minutes, I was getting help from not just Microsoft, but the guy who works on the product I was complaining about. And his link worked!</p>  <h4>Example 2: Stackoverflow/Codinghorror</h4>
<p>I was working on a project which is using a lot of the same libraries that Stackoverflow uses. I ran into trouble with one of the components: I couldn’t figure out which version to use. So I pinged the lead developer/co-creator of SO:</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>@<a href="http://twitter.com/codinghorror">codinghorror</a> where do i get the best wmd editor for use with markdownsharp? your version on google code? <a href="http://twitter.com/mharen/status/8832078048">7:30 PM Feb 8th</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And his very prompt response:</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>r @<a href="http://twitter.com/mharen">mharen</a> our version is on Google Code, or you can dig through the fork-splosion on github and try to guess which version is &quot;best&quot; <a href="http://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/8832188858">7:33 PM Feb 8th</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <strong><em>three</em></strong> minutes I had my answer from the top guy of the a product that’s used by bajillions (if not gajillions) of people. Even if he hadn’t answered, I was hoping that someone else might (this wasn’t a private query).</p>  <h4>Example 3: Red Gate’s Neil Davidson</h4>
<p>Via Twitter, I discovered a neat little book on software pricing. I tweeted about it:</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>40% in and still interesting... RT @<a href="http://twitter.com/spolsky">spolsky</a>: A short ebook about software product pricing <a href="http://retwt.me/1bmXM">http://retwt.me/1bmXM</a> (from @<a href="http://twitter.com/neildavidson">neildavidson</a>) <a href="http://twitter.com/mharen/status/5391952110">9:10 AM Nov 3rd, 2009</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A half-hour later, I see this in my feed:</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>@<a href="http://twitter.com/mharen">mharen</a> Glad you're liking the eBook! If you have time, could you post a review on Amazon once you've finished? ( <a href="http://bit.ly/18xFJx)">http://bit.ly/18xFJx)</a>&#160;<a href="http://twitter.com/NeilDavidson/status/5392536276">9:37 AM Nov 3rd, 2009</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s at this point that I realize who wrote the book: <a href="http://www.neildavidson.com/">Neil Davidson</a>, co-founder/joint CEO of <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/">Red Gate Software</a>, and founder&#160; of the <a href="http://blog.businessofsoftware.org/">Business of Software conferences</a> among other things. A cool guy to get to know, no doubt. I finished the book and left a review as he asked and took the opportunity to ask about one of his products:</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>@<a href="http://twitter.com/NeilDavidson">NeilDavidson</a> you bet; we use a lot of your products btw--thanks! What's up with Log Rescue not supporting SQL &gt;2000? Anything planned? <a href="http://twitter.com/mharen/status/5392617100">9:40 AM Nov 3rd, 2009</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which I got a very simple and candid reply (the beauty of the 140 character limit!):</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>@<a href="http://twitter.com/mharen">mharen</a> We're not going to do any more work on SQL Log Rescue. Lots of people used it, but nobody bought, and SQL 2000 work would be huge <a href="http://twitter.com/NeilDavidson/status/5392660455">9:42 AM Nov 3rd, 2009</a></p>
</blockquote>  <hr />
<p>It’s so cool that this simple medium enables and promotes these types of quick conversations. In 2/3 of these cases, I wasn’t even trying to initiate communication—others were listening for certain things and <em>they found me</em>. </p>
<p>When I first starting toying with Twitter it seemed that its signal-to-noise ratio was cripplingly low. Now I see that by following keywords—not users—the signal is strong.</p>
<p>It also has a unique ability to cut through the BS by forcing you to choose your words carefully. I like that.</p>
