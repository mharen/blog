title: Why Computers Suck, Part 1
---

<p>I work with a lot of remote machines and this usually involves some fairly unpolished VPN software. Today’s experience definitely takes the cake. </p>  <p>When <em>you</em> login to your computer, here’s what probably happens:</p>  <ol>   <li>Turn on computer </li>    <li>Possibly enter username/password </li> </ol>  <p>Done.</p>  <p>Here’s how <em>I</em> login:</p>  <ol>   <li>Turn on my computer </li>    <li>Enter username/password </li>    <li>Launch Internet Explorer and go to specific address </li>    <li>Skip an SSL warning by clicking “Continue to this website (not recommended)”      <br />      <br /><img height="273" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/TK48N2_LBEI/AAAAAAAAA_E/PGoBPUoSdNs/image%5B38%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="750" />      <br /></li>    <li>Enter my numeric user ID, which I retrieve from an email since I can’t remember it and my PIN, and my RSA token code (changes every 60 seconds)      <br /><img height="230" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/TK48OP_v3HI/AAAAAAAAA_I/UmuBxIYNpI4/image%5B39%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="384" /> <img height="230" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/TK48ObuIkKI/AAAAAAAAA_M/9oeY7GZMJkY/image%5B40%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="351" />      <br /></li>    <li>Install some VMWare addon thingy</li>    <li>Enter my login again, but this time with a different password that I also can’t remember, and choose a different domain      <br />      <br /><img height="218" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/TK48PEvUoiI/AAAAAAAAA_Q/nf-mdvQDM5k/image%5B13%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="333" />      <br /></li>    <li>Then I accept a meaningless security warning:      <br />      <br /><img height="294" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/TK48P7tsusI/AAAAAAAAA_U/XJVmS7x7nzA/image%5B16%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="477" />       <br /></li>    <li>And ignore a JS error:      <br />      <br /><img alt="jserror1" height="410" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/TK4-zucrqPI/AAAAAAAAA_w/59NtjcdOqGw/jserror1%5B3%5D.png?imgmax=800" style="margin: 0px; display: inline;" title="jserror1" width="616" />      <br /></li>    <li>Or two:      <br />      <br /><img alt="jserror2" height="410" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/TK4-z6OM49I/AAAAAAAAA_0/6J_4tFm6vJM/jserror2%5B3%5D.png?imgmax=800" style="margin: 0px; display: inline;" title="jserror2" width="616" />      <br /></li>    <li>And another warning; this is getting ridiculous      <br />      <br /><img height="294" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/TK48QqZXLGI/AAAAAAAAA_g/BAKziy-pMzc/image%5B28%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="477" />      <br /></li>    <li>And another      <br />      <br /><img height="294" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/TK48RAounOI/AAAAAAAAA_k/qOcPwbSSuL4/image%5B31%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="477" />      <br /></li>    <li>And finally I’m ready to actually do something:      <br />      <br /><img height="181" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/TK48RqwPzgI/AAAAAAAAA_o/j2AXxVAfaRE/image%5B34%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="433" />      <br /></li>    <li>But the “connection to the View Server is not ready. Please wait.”      <br />      <br /><img height="94" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/TK48R0h4hYI/AAAAAAAAA_s/DiyPQQar28g/image%5B37%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="461" />      <br /></li> </ol>  <p>Wait for what? Apparently I took too long doing all of the above and need to start again. Yikes!</p>  <p>It’s completely not cool that this is what computers do to people. With the possible exception of entering my password, I am horrible unqualified to answer the majority of those questions.</p>  <p>As part of my job, I strive to make situations like this less common.</p>  <p>Oh, and in case you’re wondering why I have two RSA tokens in that second picture above, it’s because I have a different one for each company. Handy, right? (No.)</p>

I didn't include the fact that I started this process in Chrome, but it failed so I switched to IE-x64 and it failed, so I switched to IE-x86, and it finally worked.

But tell me the point of all these shenanigans is that you are logging in from home?

@jb : that's not my situation here, though it might as well be. My situation is that I work as a contractor for many different  companies and each one had their own progress for connecting to their network. 

The processes I posted is better than requiring a dedicated machine, or going to site, but could certainly be improved.
