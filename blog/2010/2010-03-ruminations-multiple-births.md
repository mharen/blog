title: 'Ruminations: Multiple Births; Congratulations'
---

<p>I am afraid if I ever have twins or triplets that I would try to carry too many at one time and drop one, both, all, etc. Oops!</p>
<p>And that's my segway into my congratulations to B+T on their new double-dose of parenthood. Here's a list of things to keep you occupied during your downtime (infants are boring):</p>  <ul>   <li>N/A </li> </ul>
<p>...you won't be having any of that. Sorry. Now let's <a href="http://xkcd.com/605/">extrapolate your family</a>:</p>

<p>At this rate (if my calculations are correct), the trend is slightly alarming:</p> ![image%5B14%5D.png](image%5B14%5D.png) 
<p>Of course the total number of kids you have will be a bit more dramatic:</p>

<p>The only thing I can conclude from this is that you might want to refocus your house-hunting for something in the country. With lots of room.</p>
<p>In any case, best of luck to you and enjoy these first few weeks as a family of five! Let me know if I can help in any way (I just might).</p>
