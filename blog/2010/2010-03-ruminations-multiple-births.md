title: 'Ruminations: Multiple Births; Congratulations'
---

<p>I am afraid if I ever have twins or triplets that I would try to carry too many at one time and drop one, both, all, etc. Oops!</p>
<p>And that's my segway into my congratulations to B+T on their new double-dose of parenthood. Here's a list of things to keep you occupied during your downtime (infants are boring):</p>  <ul>   <li>N/A </li> </ul>
<p>...you won't be having any of that. Sorry. Now let's <a href="http://xkcd.com/605/">extrapolate your family</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://xkcd.com/605/"><img alt="Extrapolating" border="0" src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/extrapolating.png" style="border-right-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto;" title="By the third trimester, there will be hundreds of babies inside you." /></a></p>
<p>At this rate (if my calculations are correct), the trend is slightly alarming:</p> <img alt="image" border="0" height="376" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/S4xQGbdlZpI/AAAAAAAAAqI/ufiv0Fivwmg/image%5B14%5D.png" style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px;" title="image" width="556" /> 
<p>Of course the total number of kids you have will be a bit more dramatic:</p>

<p>The only thing I can conclude from this is that you might want to refocus your house-hunting for something in the country. With lots of room.</p>
<p>In any case, best of luck to you and enjoy these first few weeks as a family of five! Let me know if I can help in any way (I just might).</p>
