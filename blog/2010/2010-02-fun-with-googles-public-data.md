title: "Fun with Google\u2019s Public Data"
---

<p>I was going to do a post about our world’s exploding population growth and stumbled upon Google’s awesome <a href="http://www.google.com/publicdata?ds=wb-wdi&amp;met=sp_pop_totl&amp;q=world+population#met=sp_pop_totl&amp;idim=country:USA:GBR:JPN:DEU:CAN:MEX:RUS:VNM">public data service</a> with my first research query:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/publicdata?ds=wb-wdi&amp;met=sp_pop_totl&amp;q=world+population#met=sp_pop_totl&amp;idim=country:USA:GBR:JPN:DEU:CAN:MEX:RUS:VNM">![image%5B13%5D.png](image%5B13%5D.png)</a> </p>
<p>I haven’t been able to uncover an index for what types of things you can show here but a little <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site:http://www.google.com/publicdata+co2">searching</a> will get you other things.</p>
<p>Anyway, so this is what I was looking for initially (<a href="http://www.vaughns-1-pagers.com/history/world-population-growth.htm">data source</a>):</p>
<p>![image%5B23%5D.png](image%5B23%5D.png)&#160;</p>
<p>And since the last 200 years:</p>
<p>![image%5B27%5D.png](image%5B27%5D.png) </p>
<p>Clearly my source data could be more complete. Even with the gaps, though, the exploding trend is obvious. It comes with this neat, mind-blowing factoid, too:</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>The total number of humans that have **ever lived</b> has been estimated at <b>110 billion</b>.      <br /><b>Approximately 6% of all those people are alive today.**</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Wow</em>. With the modern improvements to <a href="http://www.google.com/publicdata?ds=wb-wdi&amp;q=lifespan#met=sp_dyn_le00_in&amp;tdim=true">life expectancy</a> and high rate of population growth (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_population_growth_-_time_between_each_billion-person_growth.jpg">10-15 years per billion</a>), it might be a while before this 6% figure stabilizes (i.e. stops growing). </p>
<p>I’m not suggesting that this is a bad thing—not at all. I just find it interesting.</p>
