title: Anatomy of a Typical Sensationalist News Story
---


In our highly charged media, it’s exceedingly common (and frustrating) to see a ridiculous news headline which is not supported by the story within. Here’s what I mean; level of alarm is on the y-axis and piece of the story is on the x-axis:

Yikes! Things start out pretty serious. After keeping our attention with a few random facts, the story is finally killed by its own lame ties to reality.

![ANd9GcTku1TaBkGO35bPzfdoNsVfxvlAUV2mwWl5rU8yTLU8mqL4abI.jpg](ANd9GcTku1TaBkGO35bPzfdoNsVfxvlAUV2mwWl5rU8yTLU8mqL4abI.jpg)Here’s an actual, far less dramatic example from an [article](http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/wire/sns-prop8-judge,0,1452598.story) I read this morning:

**Headline: **
<blockquote> 

Judge who overturned Proposition 8 to retire
</blockquote>

Ohhh Prop 8—that sounds serious; **tell me more!**
<blockquote> 

Vaughn R. Walker, the federal judge who ruled that Proposition 8 was unconstitutional, will leave the bench at the end of the year for the private sector, the U.S. District Court in San Francisco announced Wednesday.
</blockquote>

Right there in the first sentence the headline is contradicted. Is he retiring or going into the private sector? Maybe he’s retiring *to *the private sector? **I’m intrigued.** Pray continue:
<blockquote> 

Walker presided over an unprecedented federal trial earlier this year that examined a wide array of questions about gays and lesbians, including whether sexual orientation can be changed and whether same-sex unions differ much from opposite-sex unions.
</blockquote>

Oh, right, that’s why this guy is famous. **Random facts, please!**
<blockquote> 

…  

Walker, 66, a Republican appointee considered a conservative with a libertarian bent, has served as a federal district judge for nearly 21 years and as chief judge of the San Francisco-based court since 2004.  

…
</blockquote>

Don’t forget to add a **slight twist:**
<blockquote> 

District chief judges are selected based on age, seniority and experience and may serve for a maximum of seven years.
</blockquote>

OK…relevance?
<blockquote> 

Walker's term would have expired next August. The court said District Judge James Ware will become chief judge in January.
</blockquote>

What, what? So he was out of there next year anyway? When he leaves, he’ll have served about 90% of his term, which is just the final chapter of more than 20 years of service. 

**There’s no story here. **Why was this on the front page?!

By the way, the Google Image results for [[Vaughn R. Walker](http://www.google.com/images?q=Vaughn+R.+Walker)]—the judge—are pretty hilarious:

Assuming he’s the old guy in a suit, hitting slots 1-3 is pretty good. After that it falls apart, though.
