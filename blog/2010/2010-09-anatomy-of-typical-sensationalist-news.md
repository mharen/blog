title: Anatomy of a Typical Sensationalist News Story
---

<p>In our highly charged media, it’s exceedingly common (and frustrating) to see a ridiculous news headline which is not supported by the story within. Here’s what I mean; level of alarm is on the y-axis and piece of the story is on the x-axis:</p>  <p><img height="428" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/TKSeK3p3S6I/AAAAAAAAAxU/4irH2fihph0/image%5B3%5D.png?imgmax=800" style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="700" /></p>  <p>Yikes! Things start out pretty serious. After keeping our attention with a few random facts, the story is finally killed by its own lame ties to reality.</p>  <p><img align="right" src="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTku1TaBkGO35bPzfdoNsVfxvlAUV2mwWl5rU8yTLU8mqL4abI&amp;t=1&amp;usg=__E6XhcvO81J4IA_iZuUmrXbcZPqs=" style="display: inline;" />Here’s an actual, far less dramatic example from an <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/wire/sns-prop8-judge,0,1452598.story">article</a> I read this morning:</p>  <p><strong>Headline: </strong></p>  <blockquote>   <p>Judge who overturned Proposition 8 to retire</p> </blockquote>  <p>Ohhh Prop 8—that sounds serious; <strong>tell me more!</strong></p>  <blockquote>   <p>Vaughn R. Walker, the federal judge who ruled that Proposition 8 was unconstitutional, will leave the bench at the end of the year for the private sector, the U.S. District Court in San Francisco announced Wednesday.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Right there in the first sentence the headline is contradicted. Is he retiring or going into the private sector? Maybe he’s retiring <em>to </em>the private sector? <strong>I’m intrigued.</strong> Pray continue:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Walker presided over an unprecedented federal trial earlier this year that examined a wide array of questions about gays and lesbians, including whether sexual orientation can be changed and whether same-sex unions differ much from opposite-sex unions.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Oh, right, that’s why this guy is famous. <strong>Random facts, please!</strong></p>  <blockquote>   <p>…</p>    <p>Walker, 66, a Republican appointee considered a conservative with a libertarian bent, has served as a federal district judge for nearly 21 years and as chief judge of the San Francisco-based court since 2004.</p>    <p>…</p> </blockquote>  <p>Don’t forget to add a <strong>slight twist:</strong></p>  <blockquote>   <p>District chief judges are selected based on age, seniority and experience and may serve for a maximum of seven years.</p> </blockquote>  <p>OK…relevance?</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Walker's term would have expired next August. The court said District Judge James Ware will become chief judge in January.</p> </blockquote>  <p>What, what? So he was out of there next year anyway? When he leaves, he’ll have served about 90% of his term, which is just the final chapter of more than 20 years of service. </p>  <p><strong>There’s no story here. </strong>Why was this on the front page?!</p>  <p>By the way, the Google Image results for [<a href="http://www.google.com/images?q=Vaughn+R.+Walker">Vaughn R. Walker</a>]—the judge—are pretty hilarious:</p>  <p><img height="220" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/TKSePdxXUII/AAAAAAAAAxY/laXS_ziuAHY/image%5B12%5D.png?imgmax=800" style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="883" /></p>    <p>Assuming he’s the old guy in a suit, hitting slots 1-3 is pretty good. After that it falls apart, though.</p>
