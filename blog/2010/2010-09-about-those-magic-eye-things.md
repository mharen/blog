title: About Those Magic Eye Things
---

<p>You know those <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autostereogram">magic eye things</a> that started showing up in the nineties? Sure you do:</p> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Stereogram_Tut_Random_Dot_Shark.png"><img alt="File:Stereogram Tut Random Dot Shark.png" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Stereogram_Tut_Random_Dot_Shark.png" style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></a> 
<p>I. Hate. Them. They don’t work for me and it’s so frustrating. This is how I feel (may not be appropriate for young audiences):</p>  <div class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent" id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:67ee3957-9411-4616-8a81-15fafcab7229" style="padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; width: 480px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 0px;">

<p>I know it’s silly and a little crazy, but damn it if it isn’t frustrating. Anyway, so something happened the other day. I was sitting in the chair at the dentist making mental notes of the ridiculous things that my oral hygienist was saying so I could tweet about them later (she was pretty nuts) when I noticed a giant magic eye on the wall in front of me. I tried my best to ignore this evil invention, which was certainly placed there only to torment me. Unfortunately, the nearby TV was blaring some Fox News capital-C-crazy babbling so my mind, and my eyes wandered to the poster. </p>
<p>Without paying much attention, this sinister picture of what I assumed to be be Skittles-vomit revealed a 3D dinosaur (obviously not what’s pictured above, unless it coincidentally contains a dinosaur, too). It worked…and I was startled. In 15 years, I have never seen the image within and then suddenly, there it was. I must admit, it left a bit to be desired.</p>
<p>The worst of it is that it hasn’t worked since. Figures. </p>
<p>Since I’m into pie charts this week, here’s the breakdown of the ol’ magic eye:</p>

I can't see them either.  Probably a good thing.  The last thing I need to escalate my dental anxiety is the fear of a 3-d dinosaur jumping off the wall and attacking me :)

I went to elementary school with a kid whose father was in charge of putting these in the newark advocate. true story.
