title: I Vote To Close This Meeting
---

So my company is doing this cool thing: they're giving every employee a tablet. <br />
<br />
The idea is that we're a tech company and can probably figure how to use them to improve efficiency or blah blah blah, and they're cool and will make us happy. Yay!<br />
<br />
So aside from making our existing tools work well on mobile and surfing the top apps/games lists in the AppStore, here's a problem I want an app for:<br />
<br />
Unproductive meetings<br />
<br />
I'm talking about meetings where people keep talking in circles, refusing to converge to a decision. Or meetings where the chit chat is getting out of hand and some of us have actual work to do.<br />
<br />
I'm guilty of this, too. Really. <br />
<br />
Most people are too polite or non-confrontational to do anything so we need something that allows people to say, "hey let's refocus here because this is all an epic waste of time" without actually saying it. <br />
<br />
Imagine everyone sitting around the conference room table with their tablets blathering on. Now suppose everyone had an app running with the following features:<br />
<br />
- the meeting agenda<br />
- a place for minutes/action items<br />
- a timer showing how much time is left<br />
- a timer indicating how much money has been spent (labor) since the meeting began<br />
- a reminder tone very 25% of the duration of the meeting<br />
<br />
Those are all highly collaborative with shared workspaces, etc. But these features are really just an excuse to deploy this:<br />
<br />
- anonymous voting buttons that allow anyone to make a statement<br />
<br />
Maybe votes only activate something if two people vote...not sure. (It's really just like voting to close questions on Stack Overflow.) I want to be able, with one or two taps, notify the group that things need to move on for some canned reason. <br />
<br />
Reasons are simple things like:<br />
- off topic<br />
- not relevant to the group (i.e. you two go figure it out later and report back)<br />
- conclusion needed (i.e. what's the action item from this thread of discussion)<br />
- other voices needed (i.e. share the podium, pal)<br />
<br />
Does this exist? Thoughts?<br />
<br />
(Apologies for any formatting issues or typos...I'm posting this from my phone.)<br />

Amazing idea, Michael. Are you going to develop the app? There are so many companies who could potentially invest or buy your technology. Let me know if you want a collaborator or a design &amp; development team.

That is an awesome idea.  As a fellow developer, I can certainly relate on the &quot;actual work to do&quot; part.  I too would be interested in hearing how serious you are about building something and wanting some help/collaboration.

On the topic of meetings, this book from the Domino Project is pretty great:
