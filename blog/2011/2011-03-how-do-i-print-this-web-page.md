title: How Do I Print [this web page]!?
---

<div class="dialog">
<div>
<h2>
TL;DR:</h2>
</div>
<div>
Press "<code>ctrl-p</code>" (in every browser ever made).
</div>
<div>
<h2>
But But But...</h2>
</div>
<div>
Where's my "print" link? Print links are about a million years old in Internet years. 
 They were needed back in the day when technology couldn't easily produce 
 "printer-friendly versions" of pages without doing server-side voodoo magic. 
 Things have been different&nbsp;*for years*, though, and separate print 
 pages are no longer necessary.&nbsp;
</div>
<div>
<h2>
But I still want one!</h2>
</div>
<div>
No.
</div>
<div>
<h2>
But this other, cooler site has one!</h2>
</div>
<div>
Odds are, their "print" button just calls "window.print()" which is 
 just short hand code for, "you're an idiot and shouldn't be trusted 
 with electricity".
</div>
<div>
Hey, don't get upset with me, I'm just translating.
</div>
<div>
<h2>
Alternate Methods</h2>

Yes, this has come up often enough lately that I felt compelled to write a page about it, and buy a [domain to redirect here](http://www.howdoiprint.com" rel="nofollow).
