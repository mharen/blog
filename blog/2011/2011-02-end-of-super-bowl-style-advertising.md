title: The End Of Super Bowl-Style Advertising
---

<p>I’m sure I’m late to this party but here it goes for those just arriving with me: the era of the big Super Bowl commercial is over. I’d like to enter into evidence exhibit A, a tweet from my coworker:</p>  <p align="center"><img alt="In the age of youtube and everyone-is-the-creator-ism, &quot;funny commercials&quot; just aren't compelling to me." height="174" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/TVC-HwCzY9I/AAAAAAAABao/P36sKWMHL5w/image%5B2%5D.png" style="margin: 3px; display: inline;" title="" width="450" /></p>
<p>He nailed it. When I have access to unlimited amusing clips (usually with no ulterior motive), watching a three hour football game is hardly an efficient delivery mechanism for untested, untargeted clips designed to manipulate me.</p>
<p>Sure I chuckled at several of them, including this favorite that I’m sure you’ve seen 800 times already:</p>  <p align="center"></p>
<p>And this close runner-up:</p>  <p align="center"></p>
<p>But those professionally produced, multi-million-dollar barely match up to what Youtubers put together. <a href="../2010/2010-11-arduino-day-6-analog-inputs.html" target="_blank">Need I remind you</a>? </p>
<p>But what about actual advertising? I for one welcome our ad-targeting, crowd-sourced robot overlords and judging from yesterday’s performance, the sooner they arrive the better.</p>
