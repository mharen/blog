I don’t think I’m going out on a limb by suggesting that <em>motivation </em>to eat better and work out more is the biggest issue. I just had a potentially evil idea for motivating people like me: blackmail yourself.</p>  <p>Suppose you had an app (e.g. a Facebook app) that recorded your “before” stats. This would capture a simple measurement like weight or BMI and (most importantly) an unflattering “before” picture of yourself. This would be like the first weigh in of <em>The Biggest Loser</em> except <strong>it’d all be private to you.</strong></p>  <p>At first.</p>  <p>The trick would be that as long <strong>as you continue </strong>to post progress each week in the form of an updated picture, updated stats, or workout summaries, <strong>things would stay private</strong>. But<strong> if you get complacent, your most recent stats would be automatically leaked</strong> to your wall for all your friends to see.</p>  <p>If you simply keep up with your plan, eventually you’ll get to post one of those sweet “after” shots (if you want).</p>  <p>I can even see a <em>Back To The Future</em> style leak where only part of the image comes into focus at first as a warning. There’s seemingly endless potential for more social aspects, too, including <em>positive support</em>.</p>  <p>So is this the worst idea ever? Genius? Been done already? Personally this would encourage me to hit the gym more often and pour less syrup on my waffles.</p>
