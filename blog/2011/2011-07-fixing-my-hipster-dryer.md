title: Fixing My Hipster Dryer
---

<p>As wonderful husbands often do, I went downstairs to switch the laundry the other day <em>without </em>being asked and discovered a load of wet clothes in the dryer. My wife likes to say the baby stole her brain so I chuckled heartily and started the dryer, assuming that she forgot to start it when she loaded it. </p>
<p>I returned a few hours later to try again at switching the laundry only to discover the clothes in the dryer were still wet. Uh oh. I turned that puppy on and found it ran, it's lint trap was empty, but it didn’t get hot.</p>
<p>Rats.</p>
<p>I called my appliance repair guy, Google, and did some reading. With the full knowledge of 10 minutes of browsing, I decide to check out this “heating element” thingamibob. First, pop open the back, right?</p>
<p>No. First make sure the vent is clear. Check!</p>
<p>Next pop the back open.</p>
<p>No! Unplug it first!</p>

<p>I was pretty sure the plug was fine but I tested it with my multimeter just in case. ~220v check!</p>
<p>Now pop it open already!</p>

<p>OK… hey, what’s that? A burned up wire?</p>
<p><img alt="IMG_20110709_160840" height="525" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-l7fWHteE77E/TiTAwn-D2YI/AAAAAAAAB98/v04y-m5NYOE/IMG_20110709_160840%25255B4%25255D.jpg" style="margin: 3px auto; display: block; float: none;" title="IMG_20110709_160840" width="700" /></p>
<p>Now’s a good time to say, “now there’s your problem.” Why’d it burn up? Who knows. Condensation, chassis short, something or other, I don’t know. Normally these wires have little clips on them that let you easily attach them to other components (don’t you love how I say “normally” like I knew that before I started this project?). Unfortunately I don’t have any of those and the one that was attached here is not really up for the job. YOU’RE FIRED WIRE CLIP GUY!</p>
<p>Never fear, I’ll just grab my soldering iron. Actually, before I go through the trouble of soldering this back together (I suck at soldering), let’s see if that’s the problem first by reattaching it with a special wire reattacher tool:</p>
<p><img alt="IMG_20110709_160811" height="525" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-kIEWOmdWCF4/TiTAxpczjRI/AAAAAAAAB-A/hVu70wyYRV8/IMG_20110709_160811%25255B4%25255D.jpg" style="margin: 3px auto; display: block; float: none;" title="IMG_20110709_160811" width="700" /></p>  <p align="left">With that attached by what is one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locking_pliers">most useful tools ever</a>, me a safe distance away, no children present, and fire extinguisher at the ready (just kidding, it was way far away), I verified the dryer operated as expected. Hooray!</p>
<p>Next I soldered the wire on, put the cover back on, and enjoyed some self congratulatory snickering. And what’s my true reward? I get to fold laundry (and avoid spending any money on this, or a new dryer).</p>

Love it :)  But, um, how is the dryer a &quot;hipster&quot;?  Is this where you said, &quot;oh, it used to be cool&quot;? ;)

Also, you don't fold laundry.  Don't lie.  But I love you anyway :)
