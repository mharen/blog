title: Statistics are Misleading At Best, Filthy Liars at Second Best
---

<p>Back in April, I somehow came across <a href="http://disruptthenarrative.wordpress.com/2011/04/24/gas-pump-activism/">this site</a> blaming President Obama for raging gas prices:</p>
<p>![obamagasprices%25255B9%25255D.jpg](obamagasprices%25255B9%25255D.jpg)</p>  
<p>The implication is that since the moment Obama took office, gas prices have gone crazy. My god! </p>
<p>Wait wait wait…why the steep decline at the end of 2008? Let’s uncrop a bit (I downloaded some public data from an energy gov site, dropped it into Excel, and annotated it with SnagIt):</p>
<p>![fuel%252520prices%25255B2%25255D.png](fuel%252520prices%25255B2%25255D.png)</p>
<p>That’s a pretty different picture, isn’t it? </p>
<p>I’m not posting this to indict or vindicate anyone. I’m not even going to guess at explanations for the dramatic changes in that chart. I only post this to encourage people to be skeptical of charts, and to be especially suspicious of sensationalism.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you hate paying $3-4 dollars/gallon in the United States…<a href="../2005/2005-09-gas-prices.html">it could be worse</a>.</p>

Here's an extreme example of nonsense line charts that I got in the mail:

What exactly is that chart showing?! It's skipping a lot of years there...
