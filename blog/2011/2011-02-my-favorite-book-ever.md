title: My Favorite Book Ever
---

<p>My favorite book ever isn’t a book. It’s a Kindle.</p>  <p align="center"><img alt="kindle-cover-and-light" height="300" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/TUoEhY5-EjI/AAAAAAAABW8/J38GJEDylaw/kindle-cover-and-light%5B2%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" style="margin: 3px; display: inline;" title="kindle-cover-and-light" width="300" /></p>  <p>I came to this party late and unwilling, like I do to most social occasions. Except I’m usually awkwardly early to social occasions. I received my Kindle 3 Wi-Fi as a Christmas gift (thanks, Mom) and knocked out my first book in just a few days. </p>  <p><a href="http://twitter.com/mharen/statuses/20875533868859394" target="_blank"><img align="right" alt="image" height="142" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/TUoEZ3qNnXI/AAAAAAAABW0/rDoAGpP9S6w/image%5B8%5D.png?imgmax=800" style="margin: 3px; display: inline; float: right;" title="image" width="300" /></a>After two weeks, I’d read three books. In the weeks since, I’ve read three more:</p>  <ul>   <li><em>The Confession</em> by John Grisham</li>    <li><em>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em> by Stieg Larrsson</li>    <li><em>The Girl Who Played with Fire</em> by Stieg Larrsson</li>    <li><em>The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets’ Nest</em> by Stieg Larrsson</li>    <li><em>The Help </em>by Kathryn Stockett</li>    <li><em>The Hunger Games</em> by Suzanne Collins</li> </ul>  <p>I voraciously tore through and enjoyed each one. </p>  <p>Six books is more than I’ve read in as many years. Why the sudden change? Initially it was the down-time of the holidays; we had a lot of help with our little ones so I could indulge in such things. Some of it is that this thing is so lightweight that I can, with my cover’s built in book-light, read in bed regularly. A good chunk is that I can read it on the elliptical machine <a href="http://twitter.com/mharen/statuses/19785257767141377" target="_blank"><img align="right" alt="image" height="139" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/TUoEac1svqI/AAAAAAAABW4/D911YahPYII/image%5B9%5D.png?imgmax=800" style="margin: 3px; display: inline; float: right;" title="image" width="300" /></a>at the gym by cranking up the font size a notch or two. And finally, it’s just so damn easy to use <strong>in a way that even paper isn’t</strong> that I can’t help but tap turn-turn-turn.</p>  <p>This all took me by surprise. Big time. If you’re on the fence w.r.t. taking the plunge on an e-reader, I suggest diving in. You’ll be in good company.</p>
