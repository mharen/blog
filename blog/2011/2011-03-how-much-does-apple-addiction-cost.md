title: How Much Does an Apple Addiction Cost?
---


Apple’s iPad2 will be released on March 11. It looks awesome, no doubt—just like the first one, released only 11 months ago. That got me thinking: how much would it really cost to feed an Apple addiction?

Before you label me a fan boy, let me offer the following facts in my defense:  <ul>   <li>I don’t have a mac (Wife has a two or three year old MacBook) </li>    <li>I have a pretty dated 30gb iPod (pre-Touch days) </li>    <li>My love of Apple is actually much bigger than Apple—I love *all technology *</li> </ul>

Moving on. For this calculation, I’ve made the following assumptions:

The addicted user will buy the following products:  <ul>   <li>A Mac every two years </li>    <li>A major non-laptop purchase every year </li>    <li>A “minor” purchase every year </li> </ul>

The calculation will be run for the following user profiles:  <ul>   <li>The <strong>poser</strong> who buys the cheapest option of whatever new crap Steve presents </li>    <li>The <strong>functional elitist</strong> who buys mid-grade all the way because they actually use it (this would be me) </li>    <li>The <strong>hardcore fan boy </strong>who goes *top of *the top of the line every time </li> </ul>

The numbers*: 



In summary, an Apple addiction costs a surprisingly little $89-198 per month. Maybe it’s just me but that’s much less than I’d have guessed it would cost to be swimming in shiny new Apple gear *all the time*. Hmmmm…

<font size="1">*Numbers do not include potentially substantial things like taxes, monthly cell charges, App Store purchases, the shakes, etc.</font>

I'm budgeting for just one mac every two years. That could be clearer, sorry
