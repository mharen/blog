title: A Ridiculous Jury Duty Questionnaire
---

<p>A while back I got a jury duty notice. A couple weeks before I was due to appear I received a huge questionnaire in the mail. This thing was more comprehensive than everything Wife and I did for premarital counseling. Over 100 questions.</p>
<p>After I sent this in, but before I had to appear the case was continued so I never appeared. With that in mind, and because no one told me not to, I’d like to share some select answers.</p>
<p>Before you think I’m just cherry-picking questions, I’m not. This thing was personal:</p>

<p>That covered my detailed family history, religion, politics, career, salary, parenting, education, etc. Yikes!</p>
<p>Here are some of my favorite answers:</p>

<p>Once I even did computer stuff <em>at </em>a pizza place.</p>

<p>Wife compelled me to <em>not attach </em>a list describing her job.</p>

<p>And finally, after nearly eight years, the secret to my lasting marriage is revealed in question 102.</p>

<p>As a genuinely curious person, with a strong sense of civic duty, I was sincerely disappointed that this fizzled out as quickly as it did. I’ve seen <em>12 Angry Men </em>and tons of <em>Law and Order </em>so I’m basically an expert.</p>
<p>(Apologies for any damage my handheld “scanner” causes to your eyes.)</p>
