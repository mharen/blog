title: How to Cook Bacon on a George Foreman Grill

<p>Place strips of bacon on hot grill:</p>  <p><img alt="IMG_20110131_194415" height="700" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-qcan_nVmye4/TiTIugBhjCI/AAAAAAAAB-w/fqzCqgmC8WA/IMG_20110131_194415%25255B4%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" style="margin: 3px auto; display: block; float: none;" title="IMG_20110131_194415" width="525" /></p>  <p>Burn grill marks into bacon, without cooking evenly.</p>  <p><img alt="IMG_20110131_194319" height="700" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-w7MR752Qmlc/TiTIxg7ZWTI/AAAAAAAAB-0/TpB2TH9QfAk/IMG_20110131_194319%25255B4%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" style="margin: 3px auto; display: block; float: none;" title="IMG_20110131_194319" width="525" /></p>  <p>Eat bacon anyway.</p>  <p>Never try cooking bacon this way again.</p>  <p>(Note: this was attempted for convenience, not in a doomed attempt to make bacon healthier.)</p>

You forgot to mention to make sure not to burn your foot on the grill like Micheal Scott- 

&quot;I enjoy having breakfast in bed. I like waking up to the smell of bacon- sue me- and since I don''t have a butler, I have to do it myself. So most nights before I go to bed I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill. Then I go to sleep. When I wake up, I plug in the grill. I go back to sleep again. Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon. It is delicious. It''s good for me. It's the perfect way to start the day. Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot. That''s it. I don't see what's so hard to believe about that&quot;

Good advice, and no worries on the spelling.
