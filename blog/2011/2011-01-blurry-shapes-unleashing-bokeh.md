title: 'Blurry Shapes: Unleashing the Bokeh'

While browsing the excellent photography Stack Exchange site and learning lots about <a href="http://photo.stackexchange.com/q/2706/380#2710" target="_blank">bokeh</a>, I came across the <a href="http://www.diyphotography.net/diy_create_your_own_bokeh" target="_blank">awesome idea</a> that led to this shot:  

![DSC_0417%5B6%5D.jpg](DSC_0417%5B6%5D.jpg)

The effect here is in the Christmas lights—they’re regular lights—and by adding this lens filter, stuff that’s normally blurry goes crazy:

With this in place, the image on the left turns into the image on the right (similar focus distance):

Cool post, honey :)  Sorry about my super photography knowledge stealing your thunder.  You probably now know how I feel about every other thing in the world that is not directly related to babies, music or photography (and some things that are).
