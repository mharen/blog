title: 'Windows: Improving the Command Window, if Only Slightly'
---

<p>I’ve long loved the command line user interface. Ever since I <em>fully</em> immersed myself in Linux during college, I have loved me some ssh goodness. I have enjoyed popping open OSX’s Terminal and finding familiarity there, too.</p>
<p>But on Windows, cmd.exe just isn’t enough. Recent versions have brought tab completion but it’s still a far cry form a tcsh or bash shell. I tried using Putty and Cygwin to simulate the experience on windows but it never rang true and isn’t available when I use other machines or servers.</p>
<p>One breakthrough I discovered today helps a lot, though: you can make your window <em>wider than 80 characters.</em> I’m embarrassed that I didn’t discover this years ago. This is for the poor saps like myself who didn’t know:</p>  <p align="center">![image%5B10%5D.png](image%5B10%5D.png)</p>
<p>And there you go:</p>

<p>While you’re in there, you might as well choose a pretty font like Consolas, too.</p>

These are a couple great little tips. I never realized you could do this. I always just assumed it was stuck in a state of complete suck. Now it's only an incomplete suck.
