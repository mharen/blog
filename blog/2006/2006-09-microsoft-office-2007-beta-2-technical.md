title: Microsoft Office 2007 (Beta 2, Technical Refresh)
---

![office2007_ltr.gif](office2007_ltr.gif)The geek in me continues. As many of you know, I use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> (<a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a>) at home (to host this webpage, for example) and love it. Many of you also know that I do <em>not</em> have a unfounded hatred toward Microsoft, Apple, or the Linux-style products. In fact, I have a Windows laptop for work, an ancient iBook from college, and an even more ancient Linux server in my garage hosting this page. I like all three systems for different reasons.

I will say this, though: Microsoft Office blows all other office-style applications out of the water. Now that Microsoft is releasing <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/default.mspx">Office 2007</a>, game over. I have been using the beta for the last couple of months and it rocks. I know that I’m a big nerd for being excited about a software product but hey, I use <em>Office </em>more than I use a lot of other things deserving of attention (e.g. my car, TV, etc.) so why not?

<a class="imagelink" href="http://www.wassupy.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/Office2007InUse.png" title="Office 2007 on my machine">![><p class=](><p class=)This is of particular interest to me because one of my personal interests is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">GUI</a> <a href="http://www.iie.org.mx/Monitor/v01n03/ar_ihc2.htm">design</a>, including the study of how people use computers. I have long believed that if you are semiliterate and become confused while using an application, it is the application’s fault.

So if you are brave enough to try out beta software, give Office 2007 a go. I think you can <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/beta/overview.mspx">download it</a> for $1.50, though it was free when I got my copy. You can also take a “<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/beta/testdrive.mspx">test drive</a>” where you use a remote copy via a web browser so you can try it out without installing it.

You can already <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/">read a lot more</a> about it from the developers themselves.
