title: A conversation I had with Michael today
---

Michael: in computers, what is 1*1.5?

sarah: 2

Michael: good guess<br />no

sarah: 1<br />?

Michael: it is typically 12<br />1<br />1<br />integer arith.

sarah: ah<br />i forgot about that

Michael: i just discovered a HUGE thing in VB that shocked me

sarah: so 1*1.9 is 1, too

Michael: yes

sarah: what's that?

Michael: CINT(1.9) is used to convert the argument to an integer<br />so, i would expect...<br />CINT(1.9) = 2<br />wait<br />I would expect cint(1.9)=1

sarah: ya<br />no?

Michael: it doesn't. Cint ROUNDS....holy shit

sarah: :)

Michael: i called bryan. he didn't believe me

sarah: crazy!

Michael: this is so backwards

sarah: you guys are nerdy<br />:)

Michael: seriouslyt

sarah: i know!

Michael: it gets worse

sarah: it's so awesome!<br />and crazy!<br />crazily awesomely crazy!

Michael: it uses scientific rounding -- it rounds .5 to the nearest even!<br />cint(1.5) = 2<br />cint(2.5) = 2

sarah: omg no way!

Michael: so to go from assuming it simply truncated to now rounding ina very unusual way is very disconcerting<br />you think you are funny but you are not.
