title: Because it's what Jesus Would Freaking Do
---

<img align="right" alt="Izzy and Alex" id="image515" src="http://www.wassupy.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/izzyalex.jpg" style="padding: 3px;" />Sarah and I have been catching up on <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/greysanatomy/">Grey's Anatomy</a> for the last few months. The title quote, "because it's what Jesus would freaking do," comes from season 2, and is funniest line I have heard in a long, long time. If you are not famiiar with it, let me bring you up to speed. If you're not at all familiar with the characters, you'll just have to take my word for it--this is funny stuff.

At this point in the show, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0150362/">Alex</a> has just recently cheated on <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001337/">Izzie</a>, breaking up the sorta-couple they'd formed. She is angry at everyone for helping him study but eventually helps him, too. When he asks why, she answers with restrained rage a variant of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWJD">popular phrase</a>.<br /><p align="center"><img alt="Alex and Izzy" id="image516" src="http://www.wassupy.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/izzyalexabc.jpg" /></p><br />I snagged those images from <a href="http://www.tvsquad.com/bloggers/sarah-gilbert/">TV Squad</a> and <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/greysanatomy/">ABC</a>.
