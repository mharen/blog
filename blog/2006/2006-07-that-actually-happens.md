title: That Actually Happens?!
---

Michael and I were watching the first season of Grey's Anatomy the other night and in one of the <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/greysanatomy/episodes/2004-2005/5.html">episodes</a>, they discovered a surgical towel that had been left inside someone's chest from a previous surgery!  A TOWEL!  I was like, dude, good thing that doesn't happen in real life cause that would be super scary.  Turns out it <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/07/19/rfid_surgery_debris/">DOES</a> happen! In fact, it is common enough that a company has decided to produce RFID sponges - this way a wand can be waved over a patient which will let the doctor know if there are any sponges remaining inside before sewing the patient up.

I can't imagine being the test subject in this study:<br /><blockquote><br /><p align="left">"Hey, how'd you get 100 bucks?"</p><br /><p align="left">"Well, my doctor was operating on my abdomen and they hid sponges inside of me before sewing me up.  Then they tried to find them.  Sortof like a scavenger hunt."</p><br /></blockquote><br />Better use a metal detector, too...imagine the doctor going out to his car after a 12 hour shift only to find he had "misplaced" his keys.
