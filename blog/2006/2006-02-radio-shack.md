![rsk_header_logo.gif](rsk_header_logo.gif)[This](http://ldopa.net/2006/02/21/radio-shack-announces-free-tv-downloads/) is hilariously clever.

In other news, Radio Shack is [headed down the tubes](http://www.forbes.com/technology/feeds/afx/2006/02/20/afx2539792.html). Big shocker there...when's the last time you bought something at Radio Shack? 1996?
