title: Sailing the Great Lakes
---

I went sailing last month for three days with some coworkers. It <a href="http://www.wassupy.com/gallery2/main.php?g2_itemId=3637">was awesome</a>.<br />
<div style="text-align: center;">![DSCF1813.JPG](DSCF1813.JPG)This year, there were six legs. I was on leg five and had a blast. We drove up on a Friday and met the boat around 5pm. The previous crew lingered for a while but eventually headed home. We went out for the first of several fantastic dinners. After a huge meal and lots of drinking, we stopped by two bars before we made it back to the boat to bunk for the night.

The highlight of the first night would probably be a crazy old man we ran into at the last bar. His name was drinky or rinky or blinky or something like that. He never took a drink, though he went through the whole cheers thing over and over. He continuously tried to pick fights with each of us while muttering something unintelligible. Old people are funny.<br /><p align="center">![]()You can also read details from legs 1-4 in the <a href="http://www.bumboat.com/log/log2006north.htm">Captainâ€™s Log</a>.
