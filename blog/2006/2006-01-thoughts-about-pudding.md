title: Thoughts About Pudding
---

<ul><li>I think pudding is capable of ending all wars and conflicts.</li><br /><li>I think it is weird that I can buy both refrigerated and non-refrigerated pudding.</li><br /><li>Cafeteria pudding usually sucks. That's because it's not real pudding.</li><br /><li>Low-cal pudding isn't very good either, but it will doâ€”when it comes to pudding, take what you can get.</li><br /><li>You can eat pudding with a spoon <em>or</em> fork. It's so versatile!</li></ul>

And one final random though (not related to pudding)...<br /><ul><br />	<li>Why is it that it takes hours and hours to freeze a slice of lasagna but I can reheat the same frozen block in only 90 seconds? Come on!</li><br /></ul>
