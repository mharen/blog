<p align="center"><img alt="Reporter" src="http://www.wassupy.com/blog-images/wallsten.jpg" title="Reporter" /></p><br />This isn't much of a come-back post, but hey, I was laughing pretty hard when I heard about <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/06/14/bush-reporter-shades/">this</a> on the news.
