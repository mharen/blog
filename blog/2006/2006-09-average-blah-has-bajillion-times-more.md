![mouse.jpg](mouse.jpg)I have heard this phrase <a href="http://www.realtechnews.com/posts/2933">over</a> and <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifehack/average-desk-harbors-400-times-more-bacteria-than-average-toilet-seat.html">over</a> and <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/08/13/toilet_filthy/">over</a> and <a href="http://www.wellnessjunction.com/athome/disease_prevention/gerba.htm">over</a> again. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MythBusters_%28season_1%29#Toothbrush_Surprise">Mythbusters</a> even did a show slightly related to this.

Now we have a <a href="http://www.lewispr.com/us/wire/index.php?news_id=1915">mouse</a> designed to tackle this "problem". Work with me here...if you clean your bathroom regularly (or even occasionally!), but rarely clean your desk, which do you expect to be cleaner?<br /><ul><br />	<li><strong>Here's an idea: clean your desk.</strong></li><br /></ul><br />This just in: recently washed stuff is cleaner than unwashed stuff! Holy crap!

Just to take this to an obscene extreme, I took the liberty of creating a headline generator. Fill in the blanks and click "Surprise Me".

A number: <input id="toiletNumber" size="4" title="a number" type="text" value="538" /> and an object: <input id="toiletObject" size="6" title="object" type="text" value="banana" /> and <input type="button" value="Surprise Me" /><br /><h3 id="toiletHeadline">
