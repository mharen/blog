<p align="center"><img alt="Boom!" id="image521" src="http://www.wassupy.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/apex-chem-fire.jpg" /></p><br />Thanks to all of you out there that called to make sure I was still alive. It seems that half of the 32,000-person town (Apex, NC) 8 miles to my north was evacuated last night because of a <a href="http://news.google.com/?q=Chemical+Fire+Apex+NC">fire and 20+ explosions</a> at a <a href="http://www.eqonline.com/locations/EQ_North_Carolina.asp">chemical storage plant</a>. As of Friday night, some people are still not permitted to go home.<br /><p align="center"><img alt="Sizzle" id="image522" src="http://www.wassupy.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/chem-plant-after.jpg" /></p><br /><p align="left">The plant is about a 1/2 mile from my office so I was not able to get to work today--damn near the entire town was shutdown. This is  downtown Apex at rush hour today. A ghost town.</p><br /><p align="center"><img alt="Apex downtown at rushhour.
