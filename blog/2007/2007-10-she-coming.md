title: She's coming!
---

I had my ultrasound this morning and it looks like Peanut will be joining us tomorrow!  My fluid looks good, she's practicing her breathing, moving all around, and she did well on the Non-Stress Test (which is where they monitor her heartbeat with relation to contractions and movement).  But...she's now measuring in the 20th percentile (down from the 45th 3 weeks ago).  Her measurements were almost exactly the same as they were 3 weeks ago and according to the ultrasound weight (which I know can be off) she's only gained 6 ounces in that time, which puts her at 6lbs. 11oz.  So the doctor wants to start the induction tonight with cervidil and then hit me hard with the pitocin tomorrow.  I'm still hoping to go natural (as natural as I can, anyway!) so I'm hoping Michael is up for it!  I'll let you know how it goes :)
