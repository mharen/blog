title: Moving Again
---

I apologize for the lack of updates to the blog--I've got some things coming down the pipe so stay tuned.

On a personal note, I have some updates for you. We have (finally) sold our house in NC and are moving into a new (to us) house in Kent at the end of the month. We're really excited to get the place all ready for Peanut so expect several updates as we go along.
