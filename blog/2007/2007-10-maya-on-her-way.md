title: Maya's on Her Way
---

We saw Maya on the ultrasound again today. She's looking good. The doctor was a little concerned that she might not be growing quite as fast as she would have liked so she went ahead and scheduled us for induction *tonight*. The first step is <a href="http://www.birthingnaturally.net/birthplan/intervention/cervidil.html">Cervidil</a> which should help prepare Sarah for Saturday when they give <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytocin">pitocin</a>. Maya will probably be born tomorrow afternoon.

We're very excited!

Here's a ruminition I had before Sarah got pregnant to tide you over: "I am afraid if I ever have twins or triplets that I would try to carry too many at a time and drop one."
