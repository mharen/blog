title: Fun Times at Niagara Falls With the Kiddos
---

<p>Wife and I first visited Niagara falls as something of a last little vacation before Thing1 was born. We’d never been and were curious what all the fuss was about. It gave us a fun story actually…</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>The car broke down on the way out. We were determined, though. We were towed to a shop where we left it to be fixed and took a rental to the rest of the way. We had a great overnight trip, saw the falls, laughed, etc., and then returned to God-forsaken Youngstown to pick up the car.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good times. Anyway, we happened to find ourselves in Canada again last month. I had an appointment at the border crossing at Niagara Falls to interview for my Nexus trusted traveler card so we had a perfect opportunity to visit again.</p>
<p>But now we have a gaggle of children…so it’s even better :)</p>

<p>They loved it! </p> ![07-2012-10-26%25252015.55.37%25255B2%25255D.jpg](07-2012-10-26%25252015.55.37%25255B2%25255D.jpg) 
<p>That’s the iPhone’s native panorama. Here’s the same shot with the 360 app:</p>  <div style="text-align: center;"></div>

<p>It’s fun reliving these experiences with them.</p>  <hr />
<p>Except for the driving, they’re fun travel companions, too.</p>  <p align="center">![02-2012-10-24%25252019.18.09%25255B5%25255D.jpg](02-2012-10-24%25252019.18.09%25255B5%25255D.jpg)</p>
<p>Thank God for this woman. Whenever you see my kids behaving or being cute, it’s because of her.</p>

<p>I don’t remember what exactly was going on here…but they’re all in one place so I probably thought that was significant enough to document it with a photo.</p>  <p align="center">![13-2012-10-27%25252008.26.26%25255B6%25255D.jpg](13-2012-10-27%25252008.26.26%25255B6%25255D.jpg)</p>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving!</p>
