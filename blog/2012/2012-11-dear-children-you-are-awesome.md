title: 'Dear Children: You Are Awesome'
---

<p>If you know me, you know that I can’t stop yammering about my kids. I won’t apologize for it: they’re great.</p>
<p>This occurs to me regularly. For instance, on Saturday I had the intimidating task of entertaining the kids by myself for the evening (Wife was busy). We had a great time. We didn’t do anything fancy—just wandered around the toys and Christmas decorations at Target and Lowes—but everyone was laughing and smiling and having fun.</p>  <p align="center">![10-2012-11-17%25252019.12.06%25255B5%25255D.jpg](10-2012-11-17%25252019.12.06%25255B5%25255D.jpg)</p>
<p>It helped that I remembered to feed them.</p>

<p>It’s not always so easy (we’re all cranky once in a while) but we’re having more and more good days as they get older and more independent. <strong>This is my message to new parents: it’s rough early on. But it gets better, easier, and so much more fun! Hang in there!</strong></p>
<p>They start creating fun for themselves.</p>
<p>![04-2012-11-15%25252007.41.33%25255B3%25255D.jpg](04-2012-11-15%25252007.41.33%25255B3%25255D.jpg)</p>
<p>And doing their own things.</p>
<p>![05-2012-11-15%25252019.22.10%25255B3%25255D.jpg](05-2012-11-15%25252019.22.10%25255B3%25255D.jpg)</p>
<p>And sometimes they even like each other. Especially when they’re cold.</p>
<p>![03-2012-11-09%25252021.18.39%25255B3%25255D.jpg](03-2012-11-09%25252021.18.39%25255B3%25255D.jpg)</p>
<p>And when we’re really, really lucky they wake up so happy that you can’t help but wake up happy, too.</p>

<p>Happy Thanksgiving from the Harens!</p>
