title: "How I Discovered Amazon\u2019s Impressive Gift Wrap Service Via a Generous\
  \ Friend"
---

<p>I received an unexpected package today from Amazon. Hmmm…</p>

<p>I opened it and started to get excited. It wasn’t what I usually get from Amazon (batteries, pink toys, etc.).</p>

<p>It turns out that my friend Mark sent me a birthday present! Woot! I was very impressed by the presentation. Each item had a fancy wrapping, a fancy ribbon, and a fancy card.</p>

<p>I guess I’m known for my fruity shirts. </p>
<p>The gifts are perfect, and they arrived like a sir.</p>

<p>I’m actually shocked the kids adapted so quickly to it all. Thing 1, and Uncle Chris:</p>

<p>Thanks, Mark! I’ve got some learnin’ to do.</p>

<p>Some day I’ll remember to give you your Christmas present from last year.</p>

I'm surprised by how much I love the horse mask.  I just wish I could wear it long enough without laughing to actually be funny!
