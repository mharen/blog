<p>Vote. </p>
<p>When will you vote? Specifically…what time? What will you be doing before you vote? Apparently thinking about this in advance <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/07/16/156571493/can-science-plant-brain-seeds-that-make-you-vote">might increase</a> the chance that you will actually do it.</p>
<p>It’s important and I suggest you <a href="https://www.google.com/elections/ed/us/vote">plan ahead</a>.</p>
<p>Vote for progress. Vote for rights. Vote for the rights of others. </p>
