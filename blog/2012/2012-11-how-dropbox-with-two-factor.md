title: How Dropbox with Two-Factor Authentication Neatly Handles Application Specific
  Passwords
---

<p>I am a long time fan of Dropbox and <a href="http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=180744">two-factor authentication</a> (there’s a cool video there that explains what two-factor auth is if it’s news to you). When Dropbox added support for the “pain in the ass but worth it” way of making my data super (SUPER!) safe, I jumped on board.</p>  <p>It didn’t occur to me until today, though, how they handle application-specific passwords. That is, passwords for apps that aren’t aware of this two-factor business.</p>  <p>Google handles this in a pretty straight forward (but painful) way by simply letting you create application specific passwords as you need them:</p>  <p><img height="323" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-GxIq_o4yq3c/UJSAVefNayI/AAAAAAAAFKs/AoonZ1P0ur8/asp1%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800" style="float: none; margin: 3px auto; display: block;" title="asp1" width="621" /> <img height="315" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-Knub5TJrao0/UJSAWZfkNXI/AAAAAAAAFK0/faIz7pOsnBA/asp2%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800" style="float: none; margin: 3px auto; display: block;" title="asp2" width="658" /></p>  <p>So when my phone’s document scanning app (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jotnot-scanner/id307868751?mt=8">JotNot</a>) complained that I couldn’t connect it to Dropbox, I realized the issue was that I had added two-factor authentication since I hooked the two things together. So I went looking for a way to generate an application-specific password for the app. </p>  <p>I was surprised that I couldn’t find a way to do this so I turned to Google and <a href="http://blog.binaryfactory.ca/2012/08/dropbox-two-step-authentication/">found this</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>“The menu to create application specific passwords doesn’t seem to be directly available, but don’t worry, as soon as you will add a new app, <strong>Dropbox will detect the failure to login and email you the link to create an application specific password.</strong>”</p> </blockquote>  <p>Oh. Alright, let’s try that! I opened up the app and entered my Dropbox login and it failed (expected) and received this in my email:</p>  <p><img alt="Hi Michael, We noticed that you recently tried to log in to Dropbox with a password that you haven’t changed in a while. Your old password has expired and you’ll need to create a new one to log in. Please visit this page to update your password: https://www.dropbox.com/password_expired?email=redacted Thanks, The Dropbox Team" height="385" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-3J-MEw7Jm6E/UJSAW9KXtcI/AAAAAAAAFK8/Lbl5svIf_UU/expired%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800" style="float: none; margin: 3px auto; display: block;" title="" width="624" /></p>  <p>OK, that’s true—my password is probably pretty old. I skipped the link here (phishing and all that) and just went directly to the dropbox website to change my password since apparently it has “expired.” Then I tried to login with my scanning app again. It failed (again, expected) but this time I got this in my email:</p>  <p><img alt="Hi Michael, We see that you recently tried to connect the JotNot app to your Dropbox. Because you have two-step verification turned on for this account, you'll need to use a special one-time password for this application. To get your password, please visit this page. You can see all the apps you've added by visiting your account page.

Let’s do that.</p>  <p><img alt="uber secret" height="394" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-ZgtN_wcQy1k/UJSAYale4SI/AAAAAAAAFLM/2APZfwJNC4k/uber%252520secret%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800" style="float: none; margin: 3px auto; display: block;" title="uber secret" width="532" /></p>  <p>Cool, there is (at least before I sanitized it for this blog) a longish, random password I can enter on my phone.</p>  <p align="center"><img alt="2012-11-02 21.37.14" height="450" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-86CZ1BamG3s/UJSAZREvjdI/AAAAAAAAFLU/2W6T1pO8guY/2012-11-02%25252021.37.14%25255B3%25255D.png?imgmax=800" style="margin: 3px 0px; display: inline;" title="2012-11-02 21.37.14" width="300" /><img alt="2012-11-02 21.37.27" height="450" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-dMSsnD8Ir6M/UJSAaEWBHnI/AAAAAAAAFLc/CM_HefYwQ_0/2012-11-02%25252021.37.27%25255B3%25255D.png?imgmax=800" style="margin: 3px 0px; display: inline;" title="2012-11-02 21.37.27" width="300" /></p>  <p>Woot! Now I’m linked up and can continue scanning documents into my Dropbox.</p>  <p>So how do Google and Dropbox compare in their approaches? <strong>I really, really like that Dropbox sends you an email when you need an application specific password.</strong> This is great because the app itself didn’t give me any useful indication that this was the issue (it just said my login was bad). This is a brilliant idea.</p>  <p>It would be nice if Dropbox allowed me to just go and add the new password without waiting on the email. Or they could at least add a note near their password settings in my profile explaining how this works (or maybe I missed it). Two-factor is a pain (without it, none of the above would have happened), but considering the benefits, and how smoothly it’s been implemented, I highly recommend it.</p>
