title: Halloween Abroad
---

<p>I travel semi-regularly for work and it just so happened that we’d be in Canada during our town’s trick-or-treat. The kiddos love candy, costumes and friends, so trick-or-treat is a pretty big deal to them and they would be bummed to miss out. Luckily, their mommy is amazing.</p>  <p>She couldn’t really make up for being away from friends, but Sarah could arrange plenty of activities. First, we went to Dussel Farms to get pumpkins and do the <a href="http://footedjammies.blogspot.com/2012/11/nablopomo-begins.html">How Tall This Fall thing</a>, which has become a favorite family tradition. </p>  <p><img alt="06-2012-10-20 15.52.43" height="700" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/--GwrTV1uVuk/UJM1DL9g7tI/AAAAAAAAFJs/JzqcoqxEUbA/06-2012-10-20%25252015.52.43%25255B7%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" style="float: none; margin: 3px auto; display: block;" title="06-2012-10-20 15.52.43" width="517" /></p>  <p>Then we went to Giant Eagle for their in-store trick-or-treat. I know it sounds cheesy, but it’s actually a pretty neat thing. The store sets up a dozen stations in a loop, each staffed with some very friendly volunteers who compliment the kids and give them treats. To find the stations you follow along with a set of riddles written just right for 3-5 year olds.</p>  <p><img alt="05-2012-10-20 14.29.44" height="435" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-pN0HF5MylCk/UJM1FOL0HDI/AAAAAAAAFJ0/N2DUaLOfmSk/05-2012-10-20%25252014.29.44%25255B7%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" style="float: none; margin: 3px auto; display: block;" title="05-2012-10-20 14.29.44" width="700" /></p>  <p>It was more difficult than you might imagine to get three costumed kids to sit still and near each other for more than 0.5 seconds.</p>  <p>And lastly, Sarah found a public, kid-friendly Halloween party at a community nearby where I was working (and we were staying) in Ontario. They had music, activities, and ended the event with a march around the park led by a float (I guess it was technically a parade…but we were all in it).</p>  <p><img alt="10-2012-10-27 18.11.49" height="525" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-k3F0jpWzvBA/UJM1HVlrh4I/AAAAAAAAFJ8/aqjjXykioKg/10-2012-10-27%25252018.11.49%25255B7%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" style="float: none; margin: 3px auto; display: block;" title="10-2012-10-27 18.11.49" width="700" /><img alt="11-2012-10-27 18.12.01" height="438" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-Y3BPtH8zY9Y/UJM1JmpfCwI/AAAAAAAAFKE/gGkUfDyEQqk/11-2012-10-27%25252018.12.01%25255B7%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" style="float: none; margin: 3px auto; display: block;" title="11-2012-10-27 18.12.01" width="700" /></p>  <p>(It was <em>very </em>cold.)</p>  <p><img alt="08-2012-10-27 18.06.13" height="700" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-7cMJ-2qRMDY/UJM1LfA5fwI/AAAAAAAAFKM/UhC_x-mWAys/08-2012-10-27%25252018.06.13%25255B7%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" style="float: none; margin: 3px auto; display: block;" title="08-2012-10-27 18.06.13" width="525" /></p>  <p><img alt="09-2012-10-27 18.09.51" height="525" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/--JQkWfOEpSo/UJM1Nqe-5wI/AAAAAAAAFKU/Gh7SWni56Y8/09-2012-10-27%25252018.09.51%25255B7%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" style="float: none; margin: 3px auto; display: block;" title="09-2012-10-27 18.09.51" width="700" /></p>  <p>This is from a warmer day a week or so earlier, during the nice part of Fall.</p>  <p><img alt="01-2012-10-14 13.57.36" height="451" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-Snt3OouYOBA/UJM1Q7ynH6I/AAAAAAAAFKc/7i1tqqtA9PQ/01-2012-10-14%25252013.57.36%25255B8%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" style="float: none; margin: 3px auto; display: block;" title="01-2012-10-14 13.57.36" width="700" /></p>
