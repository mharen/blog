title: Searching in Outlook
---

<img align="left" alt="Outlook" src="http://www.wassupy.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/outlook-icon.jpg" />Love it or hate it, Outlook is <em>the </em>email solution for a lot of people. When it comes to work-related email, I'm one of those suckers.

Now that Google has spoiled us with archive-and-search-everything email, I've run into issues with my enormous work inbox. I have mimicked by gmail setup in Outlook with the aid of the fantastic search tool Lookout.

Lookout was acquired by MS a few years ago but was apparantly discarded. More on that from <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/12/24.html">Joel Spolsky</a>. The original author clearly explained how to <a href="http://www.majorgeeks.com/Lookout_d4808.html">obtain</a> and <a href="http://www.belshe.com/2007/12/06/how-to-install-lookout-on-outlook-2007/">configure Lookout for Outlook 2007</a>.

If you're stuck with Outlook, consider this free tool to make searches quick and easy.

One final tip: if you are using Outlook 2007 and hate that annoying "Click here to enable lame instant search" nag bar, fear not. This is how to disable it:<br /><p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
