title: Firefox 3.0 (RC1)
---

Heads up: <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-rc.html" id="rs9l" title="Firefox 3.0 RC1">Firefox 3.0 RC1</a> is out. If you are running the betas or anything from the 2.x branch, I recommend trying out Firefox 3.0. It's much, much improved. Aside from the polish that has been rubbed into the interface, the damn thing is fast.<br /><p align="center"><img alt="Firefox Logo" src="http://www.wassupy.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/firefox-logo.jpg" /></p><br />I'm not one of those browser benchmarkers, this is just from casual use. Now that I've been on the 3.0 train for a while, using a 2.x build is a little painful--you don't notice the tiny delays between page loads until they are gone...and come back.

I don't care if it's just a visual rendering tweak or actually a performance improvement (a better network interface, a better memory manager, more aggressive caching, etc.)--it doesn't really matter because the fact is, I perceive it to be significantly faster.

Anyway, I think it's safe to go ahead and get the release candidate build. It'll upgrade you to the final copy when it eventually comes out in a few weeks.
