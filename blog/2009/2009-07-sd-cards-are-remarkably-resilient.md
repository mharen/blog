title: SD Cards are Remarkably Resilient
---

<p>Two Januarys ago, we lost a newish 2gb SD card. I turned the living room over looking for it. Then Sarah found it yesterday in our back yard (19 months later):</p>  <p align="center">![IMG_5418%5B3%5D.jpg](IMG_5418%5B3%5D.jpg)</a> </p>
<p>It seems a puppy stole it and buried it in a shallow grave outside. This is one of the downsides of having a dog door, I guess—your pups can take things outside without your knowledge.</p>
<p>Any how I washed it off and with the exception of a little bite mark and some dirt only visible in macro mode, it looked new:</p>

<p>And it works! Woohoo for resilient technology. So that got me thinking…what else could this little card stand up to? More experiments to come (intentionally this time!)…</p>
