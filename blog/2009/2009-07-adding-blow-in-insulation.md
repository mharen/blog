title: Adding Blow-In Insulation
---

<p>I’d been thinking about adding some insulation to my attic for a while now. This year’s 30% tax credit gave me the final kick I needed to do it. I went to Lowe’s and bought 16 bags of Owens Corning blow in insulation which came with a free 24-hour blower rental. It was a tight fit but I made it in one trip:</p>  <p align="center"><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/Sm2ZwkEwp5I/AAAAAAAAAa8/Yt5ezfp9zqw/s1600-h/IMG_5542%5B8%5D.jpg"><img alt="IMG_5542" border="0" height="240" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/Sm2ZxI3HrUI/AAAAAAAAAbA/XJEYysWVbjM/IMG_5542_thumb.jpg" style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-right: 0px;" title="IMG_5542" width="320" /></a>&#160;<a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/Sm2Zx6tkrcI/AAAAAAAAAbE/SWKTZogmSCU/s1600-h/IMG_5544%5B5%5D.jpg"><img alt="IMG_5544" border="0" height="240" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/Sm2ZyqNNA3I/AAAAAAAAAbM/2xApX6WmS7k/IMG_5544_thumb.jpg" style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-right: 0px;" title="IMG_5544" width="320" /></a> </p>  <p align="left">Maya read up on the installation procedure (pamphlet in hand) while I unloaded.</p>

<p>The first step was cleanup. It took a lot longer than I anticipated as there was more junk and garbage than I thought. Insulation works best when it’s fluffy and even so all this stuff had to go. Some “before” shots:</p>  <p align="center"><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/Sm2Zz-kXleI/AAAAAAAAAbU/iYYdY373kTI/s1600-h/IMG_5558%5B7%5D.jpg"><img alt="IMG_5558" border="0" height="180" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/Sm2Z0W6ztnI/AAAAAAAAAbY/RGwX4VI5f9o/IMG_5558_thumb.jpg" style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-right: 0px;" title="IMG_5558" width="240" /></a> <a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/Sm2Z1ayJBDI/AAAAAAAAAbc/llKKk_cbbCE/s1600-h/IMG_5557%5B6%5D.jpg"><img alt="IMG_5557" border="0" height="180" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/Sm2Z19Cl-bI/AAAAAAAAAbg/GXzDvtbLZfE/IMG_5557_thumb.jpg" style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-right: 0px;" title="IMG_5557" width="240" /></a> <a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/Sm2Z21CL6iI/AAAAAAAAAbk/uNgIxz423z4/s1600-h/IMG_5556%5B10%5D.jpg"><img alt="IMG_5556" border="0" height="180" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/Sm2Z3ezQIoI/AAAAAAAAAbo/vovEwBDLeXw/IMG_5556_thumb.jpg" style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-right: 0px;" title="IMG_5556" width="240" /></a>&#160;&#160; </p>

<p>After that came the main event. With my buddy Bryan feeding the blower, I crawled around the attic adding in 6-12 inches of insulation (the base was very uneven), bringing the attic up to R-49. Here are some “after” shots:</p>  <p align="center">&#160;<a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/Sm2Z4dcFNnI/AAAAAAAAAbs/38-GfG9kmos/s1600-h/IMG_5565%5B5%5D.jpg"><img alt="IMG_5565" border="0" height="180" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/Sm2Z48-VlfI/AAAAAAAAAbw/_Ip8qa-ZUKM/IMG_5565_thumb.jpg" style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-right: 0px;" title="IMG_5565" width="240" /></a>&#160; <a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/Sm2Z5YwM8nI/AAAAAAAAAb0/wa2GnBbkVJA/IMG_5561%5B5%5D.jpg"><img alt="IMG_5561" border="0" height="180" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/Sm2Z6O5ci9I/AAAAAAAAAb8/Za38sbkP0XQ/IMG_5561_thumb.jpg" style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-right: 0px;" title="IMG_5561" width="240" /></a> <a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/Sm2Z662J8pI/AAAAAAAAAcA/mhFODMNeDYQ/s1600-h/IMG_5560%5B9%5D.jpg"><img alt="IMG_5560" border="0" height="180" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/Sm2Z7XDid-I/AAAAAAAAAcE/j1bqFdHqtC4/IMG_5560_thumb.jpg" style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-right: 0px;" title="IMG_5560" width="240" /></a>&#160; </p>

<p>Some lessons learned or things I’ll do differently next time:</p>  <ol>   <li><strong>Be more careful with estimates.</strong> I bought 16 bags and ultimately only used eight. I think I bought far too much for three reasons. First, I underestimated how much insulation I already had in my attic. Second, I think the charts the vendor supplies might be generous. Finally, I used data for a 1000sf attic but mine is more like 900sf. I easily returned the unused bags but hauling them around was a hassle. </li>    <li><strong>Put a sheet down around the attic access area.</strong> I had a lot of debris and attic dust beneath my attic steps. This would have been easier to clean up it I had put a sheet down. The shopvac did a nice job, though. Interestingly, the new insulation really was dust-free as advertised—90% of mess came from the junk I took <em>out </em>of the attic.</li>    <li><strong>Have something to entertain the helper.</strong> This job absolutely requires two people (one to feed to the blower, which is outdoors) but I’m told that job is pretty boring. </li>    <li><strong>Pick a cold day or do it earlier in the morning.</strong> It was a very mild day but damn it was still hot as hell up there. I was drenched in sweat the entire time. I cannot imagine what it’d have been like on a hot day. Jacket-weather or colder would be ideal since you have to wear long sleeves and pants anyway.</li>    <li><strong>Use more depth markers.</strong> I used about eight depth rulers throughout the attic (visible in some pictures above). I should have used 24 or more (they’re free). It would have made the process much easier as I wouldn’t have had to go back and forth so much stressing about an even layer. I’d certainly have done a better job, too.</li>    <li><strong>Collect some large pieces of cardboard in advance.</strong> I built little fences around our house fan and access steps with a bunch of chopped up boxes. This would have been much easier and cleaner if I had used larger boxes.</li> </ol>
<p>I still have one thing left to do: install the 2” board over the house fan and attic access. Currently these areas have no insulation at all. I plan to put two layers of 2” board over these, with a little insulation in between (hopefully about R-20). I might add a little framing, too, so they can be flipped up easily when the fan or steps are in use.</p>
<p>All told, I burned about 5 hours on the project, including two trips to Lowe’s. The project was more work than I expected but still easy enough (I hadn’t counted on the heat or amount of trash that I had to removed). Saving a mere $15/month (very roughly 10% of our energy bills) would give us an ROI of 12 months. I’m very confident we’ll meet or beat that.</p>

Yeah, as fascinating a device as the blower is, it loses its novelty fast.  Then you're left staring at the huge stack of insulation wishing it were a huge stack of bubble gum.  

Damn, that'd be a lot of gum.
