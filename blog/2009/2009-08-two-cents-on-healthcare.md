title: Two Cents on Healthcare
---


I’m not prepared to tackle the healthcare debate on this blog just yet. I have very strong feelings on the matter—so much so that I’m not sure where to start. I’m swirling from thought to thought unsure of how to begin writing. It’s a feeling similar to what I experience after a house move where I just walk around in circles unsure of how or what to start unpacking. So I’ll be brief. 

<strong>I fully support dramatic health care reform. I don’t know what the right solution is but what [we’re doing now](http://www.photius.com/rankings/healthranks.html) isn’t it.</strong>

Feel free to post comment with questions, clarifications, etc. but please keep it civil. This is likely to be the first of many short blurbs on the topic.

Quick note: yes I realize the WHO data are from 2000. The other data on that page are more current and equally disappointing.
