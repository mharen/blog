title: Want Some Poop With That?
---

<p>…With babies it’s not really up to you.</p>
<p>It’s true, folks, this is the ugly side of parenting. You will get baby crap on you. Daily. Sometimes twice daily (like today).</p>
<p><strong>Part I: </strong>The morning started out pretty good. I got up early, did the shave/shower/dress thing and was working on some work stuff in the living room. Wife/kids were sleeping and all was right with the world. I had an on-site customer meeting at 9 so I was planning to leave an hour later than usual. This turned out to be a mistake as I’m usually gone before the babies wake up…not today.</p>
<p>At around T-5 minutes, Sarah dropped off baby #2 so she could do the bathroom thing. Fully swaddled and quite content, we stared at each other for a couple minutes before I passed her back and readied to leave. Sarah noted that baby had leaked through her swaddle by showing me a nice, wet, mustardy stain. I muttered something you can’t say more than three times in a PG-13 movie when I discovered that this concoction of fluids resulting from frequent natural body functions was on my shirt, my undershirt, my pants, and my boxers. I had to change everything but my socks. How the hell?</p>
<p><strong>Part II:</strong> Upon arriving home after a nice (albeit sadly unproductive day) at multiple offices, I made the mistake of noting baby #1’s odor and thereby committing myself to the changing of what was expected to be a very fowl diaper. If I didn’t know better, I’d say this is what baby ate today:</p>  <p align="center"><img alt="image" border="0" height="180" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/SmfZr_8nYbI/AAAAAAAAAaw/l80Kag6ahqY/image%5B12%5D.png" style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-right: 0px;" title="image" width="182" />&#160; <img alt="image" border="0" height="180" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/SmfZsMNvMZI/AAAAAAAAAa0/98oSHu_5WF8/image%5B11%5D.png" style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-right: 0px;" title="image" width="180" />&#160;<img alt="image" border="0" height="134" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/SmfZskdyKnI/AAAAAAAAAa4/hod_OprRuRk/image%5B16%5D.png" style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-right: 0px;" title="image" width="200" /> </p>  <p align="center">An entire can of black beans (undrained), a jar of Grey Poupon and a lot of Mexican food.</p>
<p>You know the drill—diaper off, wipe, wipe, wipe (holy crap this is taking a lot of wipes), wipe, new diaper on, getting dressed, and wth? Yep, that’s crap on the pad, the outside of the new diaper, and…my hand. Dammit!</p>
<p>Worry not IRL acquaintances, we practice so much hand washing it’s getting a little ridiculous. We are going through those huge bottles of soap-refill fast.</p>
