title: My Top 9 Favorite Podcasts (Updated March 2013)
---


Although I sample a ridiculously large number of podcasts, these are the select few that I subscribe to and listen to regularly. I’ve presented them in order of “fewest unplayed episodes remaining” (which suggests how much I like each one). Again, simply being on this list means I’m a regular listener—don’t avoid the ones at the bottom—they are excellent. <ul> <li><a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/tag/freakonomics-podcast/">Freakonomics Radio</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127413729">NPR: Planet Money Podcast</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/">This American Life</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.radiolab.org/series/podcasts/">WNYC’s Radiolab</a></li> <li><a href="http://omegataupodcast.net/">Omega Tau</a> (available in English and German)</li> <li><a href="http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/">Stuff You Should Know</a></li> <li><a href="http://themoth.org/radio">The Moth Podcast</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/">Hanselminutes</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/">The Skeptics Guide to the Universe</a></li></ul>

I was going to write a lengthy description/review for each but, let’s be honest, you weren’t going to read it. Just go listen to some of these!
