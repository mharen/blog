title: My Top 9 Favorite Podcasts (Updated March 2013)
---


Although I sample a ridiculously large number of podcasts, these are the select few that I subscribe to and listen to regularly. I’ve presented them in order of “fewest unplayed episodes remaining” (which suggests how much I like each one). Again, simply being on this list means I’m a regular listener—don’t avoid the ones at the bottom—they are excellent. <ul> <li>[Freakonomics Radio](http://www.freakonomics.com/tag/freakonomics-podcast/)</li> <li>[NPR: Planet Money Podcast](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127413729)</li> <li>[This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/)</li> <li>[WNYC’s Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/series/podcasts/)</li> <li>[Omega Tau](http://omegataupodcast.net/) (available in English and German)</li> <li>[Stuff You Should Know](http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/)</li> <li>[The Moth Podcast](http://themoth.org/radio)</li> <li>[Hanselminutes](http://www.hanselminutes.com/)</li> <li>[The Skeptics Guide to the Universe](http://www.theskepticsguide.org/)</li></ul>

I was going to write a lengthy description/review for each but, let’s be honest, you weren’t going to read it. Just go listen to some of these!
