Finals are finally over! Woohoo!

-- In other news --

I saw a commerical a couple days ago. Let me lay it out for you...

[Thirty-something woman, soft focus, camera jumping in and out]

"I have a life"

"I have a dog"

"I'm a mother"

"I enjoy a good dessert &lt;smile&gt;>"

"I get constipated"

Yeah, that's about how much warning I got, too.

"I depend on ex-lax."

Good, glad to hear it. I'm sure you're dog is happy, too.
