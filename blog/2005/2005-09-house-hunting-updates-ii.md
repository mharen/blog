title: House Hunting Updates (II)
---

We bought a house today! Our agent haggled with the builder and settled on a great price--we signed a contract earlier today! We are so excited. Check out the <a href="http://wassupy.com/gallery2/main.php?g2_view=core.ShowItem&amp;g2_itemId=3162&amp;g2_page=1">photos in the gallery</a> to see our sweet new home.

So if you are heading down to or through the area (to the beach perhaps?) stop in to say hello. You could even stay the night in our extra bedroom (provided I know you of course ;)).

I'll keep all you avid readers posted as things move along.
