title: Stealing vs. Stealing...
---

This is some crazy stuff here...With stealing music, movies, and tv shows over the internet being all the rage, someone came up with a really good idea: What's the penalty for digital theft vs. actually stealing an item in a store?

Paraphrased excerpt: stealing season 2 of Alias could yield $100,000/1 yr imprisonment while downloading the entire season could yield the same jail time, but $3,300,000 in fines.
