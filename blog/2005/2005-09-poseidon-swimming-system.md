title: Poseidon Swimming System
---

Now <a href="http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/08/31/1628210&amp;tid=126&amp;tid=14" title="Automated Pool System Saves Swimmer">this</a> is damn cool. The <a href="http://www.poseidon-tech.com/us/components.html" title="Pool safety with Poseidon">Poseidon Swimming System</a> is a computer imaging system used to detect when someone is drowning. Effectively, it tracks swimmers and sounds an alert to screens, sirens, pagers, etc. when a swimmer stops moving. How cool! This is an awesome application of imaging technologyâ€”a field that typically only receives publicity for its security implications.

You might also be surprised to hear that this product has been around for several years.
