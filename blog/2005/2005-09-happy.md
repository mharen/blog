Today marks our (Michael's and my) 2 year anniversary!  No longer newlyweds, we move into the "young couple" or "20-something" category...yay :)  2 down, 50+ to go.<br />In other news, we've started house hunting in the Raleigh area and have found a pretty good prospect.  If you want to check it out, head on over to the <a href="http://wassupy.com/gallery2/main.php"> gallery</a>.<br />That's all for now :)
