title: Technology suprises
---

Here's one for the techies out there... I plugged my iPod into my Linux box today and it was automagically mounted. Wow! I know, I know, Windows and Apple users would be very suprised if that DIDN't happen. Well, there is an important detail here: the ipod is formated with HFS--an apple format, which normally wouldn't work in windows. Those windows ipod users have vfat formatted drives. I was just suprised that my kernel came with hfs support out of the box (FC3).

So anyway, yay technology. Now, if I can get itunes running under linux...
