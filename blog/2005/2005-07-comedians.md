I love comedy, who doesnâ€™t? Iâ€™ve been listening to a lot of comedy on CD lately and it makes for a great travel soundtrack. My two favorite comics are <a href="http://www.danecook.com/">Dane Cook</a> and the late <a href="http://www.mitchhedberg.net/">Mitch Hedberg</a>. I've also recently picked up a new CD by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005A0BA/qid=1122553654/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/102-9141661-0839330">Alonzo Bodden</a>.

<h3>Mitch Hedberg</h3><br />Mitch is definitely my favorite comedian. Heâ€™s been on Letterman several times and has two CDâ€™s. His <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000YTOQM/qid=1122553318/sr=8-2/ref=pd_bbs_2/102-9141661-0839330?v=glance&amp;s=music&amp;n=507846">first CD</a> is now available in stores as is his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000DZ3HR/qid=1122553318/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-9141661-0839330?v=glance&amp;s=music&amp;n=507846">second CD</a>, produced by Comedy Central. I highly recommend both discs. If you are new to Hedberg, though, go with the second disc.

I saw Mitch live last year and he was great. He had a lot of excellent new material and put on a great show. Unfortunately, he passed away last year. He will be missed. If you ever watch Comedy Centralâ€™s Comic Remix or Shorties Watching Shorties, youâ€™ve probably heard some of his jokes.

<h3>Dane Cook</h3><br />Dane cook is another of my favorite comedians. Unlike Mitchâ€™s one-liner style, Dane is more of a story teller. His first CD, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00009V7U2/qid=1122553515/sr=2-2/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_2/102-9141661-0839330">Harmful is Swallowed</a>, is excellent and highly recommended. It also seems that he has JUST released a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00009V7U2/qid=1122553515/sr=2-2/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_2/102-9141661-0839330">double-disc album</a> full of new material. I can't wait to pick it up!

<h3>Alonzo Bodden</h3><br />I just picked up a 40 minute audio of this comic through Audible. Heâ€™s a bit more like Dane Cook and definitely keeps you laughing. The general consensus seems to be that he pales when compared to Mitch, but heâ€™s definitely a good listen. Apparantly he was on last comic standing, a fact I didn't know until I started researching this post.
