title: Updates from the crypt

Finale time has come and gone, and let me tell you, what a season it has been. <h3>7th Heaven</h3>What a load of crap. Oh my goodness, I'm not sure I'll be able to express how terrible this was. I'm not even going to try. Instead, I'll just give props to the writers. I'm 100% sure this is how it went down:

Writer 1: OK guys, our show is so bad and we've been on the air so long that I bet we could outsource the script to our 4 year olds--<br />Writer 2: --or lets hire some crack hos!

Well, that's what they did. 'nough said.<h3>24</h3>This was a two-hour show. It was awesome for about 1:45. The show had been lagging a little bit but this finale was pretty good. That is, until (spoiler...) the jackass President decided that even though Jack saved the entire damn country (again, 4 seasons running) and was willing to be handed over to the Chinese government for some bullshit that happened 3 <s>weeks</s> hours ago, he's got to be killed because--get this--he knows too much.

Well pardon me, sir, but wtf? What a terrible ending! Basically, Tony and Bitchelle fake Jack's death so he can go into hiding and start a "new" life. That is, until <s>next season</s> tomorrow another terrorist does something that only Jack can handle. 

That brings up a barely related point I've been thinking about. I think that they should codeword each season with a day of the week. So season one is Monday, season two is Tuesday, etc. If they're feeling really ambitious and worry that seven days won't cover it, they could start with a date Jan 1, Jan 2, etc. Just a thought...<h3>Alias</h3>Or as I like to call it, <b>Jenny plays dress-up</b>.

This show was really, really good the first two seasons. Season three and now season four were a little slow and repetitive. The last three episodes of this season, however, have been extremely good.

As an added bonus, they may have finally dropped all this Rambaldi crap.

Now about the season cliffhanger (spoiler coming...). Holy fuck! OMG! I was completely unprepared. We had been tivo-ing the show and watching several at once so I didn't realize that as we watched the final episode there'd be a ridiculous cliff hanger. It went something like this: Syd and Vaughn get engaged at the beach and are driving away when Vaughn says some stupid thing like "I love you, and that's why I have to tell you something--I don't want us to have any secrets. For starters, my name isn't Michael Vaughn." CRASH! Episode over. What am I supposed to do with that!? I'm still lift up my jaw.
