title: So the server was down, big deal!
---

Gimme a break! Even well-oiled machines run out of disk space now and then. Of course when that happens to my webserver, the database stops serving data.

If I hadn't ignored those persistent "warning" emails I've been getting, this could have been prevented. My bad.
