<b>[Quick reminder: tourney Friday 3/4/05 at 8:30 at my house in Columbus. $5.]</b>

My weekly Sunday tourney didn't go so well this past Sunday. Actually, it was down right embarrassing. 

I was doing pretty well initially. Out of ten people, my biggest mistake occurred after five had been eliminated. I'm first to act with a decent hand J<img align="absmiddle" src="poker/diamond.gif" /> Q<img align="absmiddle" src="poker/diamond.gif" />. In general this isn't that great of a hand I've been playing pretty tight so when I raise, as expected, only one person hangs on.

The flop comes:<br /><img align="absmiddle" src="poker/kc.gif" /><img align="absmiddle" src="poker/qs.gif" /><img align="absmiddle" src="poker/td.gif" />

Not bad, an outside draw. I bet it pretty big and get a quick call. The turn:<br /><img align="absmiddle" src="poker/9h.gif" /><br />Yes, a straight! I am yea-happy. I bet big again and get another quick call. Instead of trying to figure out what this guy has, I start counting my money. The river:<br /><img align="absmiddle" src="poker/jc.gif" /><br />For a final board of:<br /><img align="absmiddle" src="poker/kc.gif" /><img align="absmiddle" src="poker/qs.gif" /><img align="absmiddle" src="poker/td.gif" /><img align="absmiddle" src="poker/9h.gif" /><img align="absmiddle" src="poker/jc.gif" /><br />OK, cool, I've got the best hand and move all in. ERRR I don't have the best hand--there's a straight on the board, the same as my straight!  How did I screw this up!? Kevin calls me with his A, a better straight, and I am eliminated for foolish, stupid play.

This seems like a good time to mention Chris' rules of poker:<ol><li>Slow Down</li><li>Watch</li><li>Think</li></ol>

I guess it's also worth mentioning that this was only a $5 game ;).
