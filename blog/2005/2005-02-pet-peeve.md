Here's a pet peeve of mine. First, let's see if you notice anything wrong with this situation:<br />![parking1.png](parking1.png)

Anything? I know this is petty. At the local kroger here, this happens all the time. Here's the problem:<br />![parking2.png](parking2.png)

You see, there isn't really enough room for two cars to pass down the ONE WAY lanes, and when that's not an issue, a car has to go back and forth 3 or 4 times to get into a spot when coming from the wrong direction. I really don't get it. What is so damn complicated about the parking lot? "Hold on," you say, "there aren't always arrows there!" Right you are, but let's be serious here. Have you figured out how they determine how the arrows go? Are you really going to argue that you can't figure out which way the lane is going without the arrows? If that's the case, please, please don't drive. In my book, I'd have to rank this as more annoying that that ass who makes side comments in class after E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G the prof says--to the point that a collective groan sounds each time.
