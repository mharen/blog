Movie reviews by Sarah

-The Incredibles<br />Wow was this movie awesome!  Seriously, you have to see it - nonstop funniness.  The short film at the beginning is also amazing.  Well worth the seven bucks you have to pay to see it - and that's high honor coming from a poor college student like myself.

-Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles<br />I realize that this movie is well over ten years old, but I saw it for the first time tonight.  Huh-lar-eee-ous.  The best part of the movie, by far, was baby splinter mimicking his master's kung-fu.  If you haven't seen this one, check it out.  Two thumbs (way) up.

-Dodgeball<br />Another good one.  This movie was leaps and bounds below Zoolander, but funny nonetheless - there were definitely laugh out loud moments (read, the S&amp;M uniform scene).  Glad I didn't see it in the theatre, but worth the rental fee.

-Elf<br />This may be my new favorite holiday movie, beating out both The Grinch and A Christmas Story.  Ok, maybe tied with A Christmas Story.  My favorite lines in the movie:<br />"Hey, I've got good news.  I saw a dog today."<br />"I'm singing...I'm in a store, and I'm singing"<br />"He's an angry elf"<br />*whispering* "I like to whisper too"

That's all for now - with school this quarter I haven't had a ton of time to see movies...Can't wait til June!!!
