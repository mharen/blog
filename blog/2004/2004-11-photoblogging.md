title: photoblogging
---

Sarah and I just got a digicam! Couple that with a recent slashdot story about photo-blogging, and I have new inspiration. I'm not really much into photography but i do like pictures so I'm going to jump on the bandwagon and start photoblogging. I'm not sure if i can commit to a new picture every day...if I did that, there'd be a lot of terrible pictures, or just lots of pictures of my hampster. I've got a new idea as to how to display the pictures, too, so when I get a chance, I'll do some coding and see how it goes.

Hopefully I can get something going here soon...

For reference, here's a <a href="http://www.orbit1.com/dailyphotos.aspx">pretty neat photoblogger</a>. He has some awesome pictures. And the <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/04/11/02/2154241.shtml?tid=149">original slashdot story</a>, which has lots of links to other photo sites.

Feel free to submit your own photos, too!

To get me started on pictures while i think about the code, I'm going to take a stab at this: <a href="http://www.sh1ft.org/26things/">26 Things</a>. They give you a list of 26 things to take pictures of for a gallery. It seems pretty neat. I'll be posting my pictures as they happen...
