Here’s a handy feature of Notepad++ that I’ve come to love: automatically highlight whatever text I’ve selected (see below).

I wanted that feature in Visual Studio so I searched and my favorite tech site [delivered](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/256931/how-to-highlight-occurrences-of-a-search-term-in-text-in-visual-studio). Here’s what [RockScroll](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/IntroducingRockScroll.aspx) does (I double-clicked dQty on line 2):

[RockScroll](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/IntroducingRockScroll.aspx) is actually advertised as providing a thumbnail picture of your code *instead of a scrollbar* as shown (borrowing Scott’s image):

The highlighting stuff I wanted is just a hidden gem. By the way, if you’re getting ready to criticize my use of Hungarian notation in the above screenshots, please save your energy. This is legacy code and our current software standard explicitly forbids its use. I think [this essay](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Wrong.html) describes a very good application for it in modern programming, though (i.e. how to use Hungarian notation properly).
