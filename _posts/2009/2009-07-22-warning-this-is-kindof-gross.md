title: Warning ~ This is kindof gross
---

You know that phrase "I just threw up in my mouth a little"?  I use it occasionally to mean that something I read/saw/heard was gross.  But Charlotte?  She <span style="font-style: italic;">actually</span> throws up in her mouth a little.  Several times a day.  Then chews.  Just thought I'd share :)
