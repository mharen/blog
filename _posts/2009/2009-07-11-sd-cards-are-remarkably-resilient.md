title: SD Cards are Remarkably Resilient
---

Two Januarys ago, we lost a newish 2gb SD card. I turned the living room over looking for it. Then Sarah found it yesterday in our back yard (19 months later):  

![]({{ "/assets/2009/dirty-sd-card.jpg" | relative_url }})

It seems a puppy stole it and buried it in a shallow grave outside. This is one of the downsides of having a dog door, I guessâ€”your pups can take things outside without your knowledge.

Any how I washed it off and with the exception of a little bite mark and some dirt only visible in macro mode, it looked new:

![]({{ "/assets/2009/cleaned-up-sd-card.jpg" | relative_url }})

And it works! Woohoo for resilient technology. So that got me thinking...what else could this little card stand up to? More experiments to come (intentionally this time!)...
