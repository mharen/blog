title: My Top 9 Favorite Podcasts (Updated March 2013)
---

Although I sample a ridiculously large number of podcasts, these are the select few that I subscribe to and listen to regularly. I’ve presented them in order of “fewest unplayed episodes remaining” (which suggests how much I like each one). Again, simply being on this list means I’m a regular listener—don’t avoid the ones at the bottom—they are excellent.

 * [Freakonomics Radio](http://www.freakonomics.com/tag/freakonomics-podcast/)
 * [NPR: Planet Money Podcast](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127413729)
 * [This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/)
 * [WNYC’s Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/series/podcasts/)
 * [Omega Tau](http://omegataupodcast.net/) (available in English and German)
 * [Stuff You Should Know](http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/)
 * [The Moth Podcast](http://themoth.org/radio)
 * [Hanselminutes](http://www.hanselminutes.com/)
 * [The Skeptics Guide to the Universe](http://www.theskepticsguide.org/)

I was going to write a lengthy description/review for each but, let’s be honest, you weren’t going to read it. Just go listen to some of these!
