I think we've made arrangements with all necessary persons (his-work, her-work, his-family, her-family, etc.) so I here you go:



**We are moving to Ohio!**

<div style="text-align: center;">![moving.JPG](moving.JPG)I am transferring from the [Apex branch](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=2521+Schieffelin+Rd,+Apex,+NC+27502+(Rovisys+NC)&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=15&amp;om=1&amp;iwloc=addr) to the [main office](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=1455+Danner+Drive,+Aurora,+OH+(Rovisys+OH)&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=15&amp;om=1&amp;iwloc=addr) in Aurora and Sarah will be hunting for new and exciting work in the area.

We're planning to move in January or February.

We're [selling our house](http://www.fsbo.com/list/90492) and will be hunting for a new one. If we don't find the perfect house before we move, apartment living will have to suffice. By the way, I know that the dead of winter is pretty much the worst time to sell a house. Spare me.

At my office, I've not informed anyone of this below management. That should happen shortly.

**Why? **

Good question. We miss our families and we decided that when we have kids, seeing the relatives a couple times a year wasn't going to cut it. We'll be about 2.5 hours away, which is still a trip, but much more reasonable than the 8.5 hours it is now.

**Why now?**

Two reasons. First, kids are on the horizon. That horizon might be 1-5 years away--who knows? Sarah's not pregnant now so you'll just have to wait like the rest of us. Second, moving is hard and I don't want Sarah skipping out on the heavy lifting with some lame excuse like, "I'm pregnant," or "I want pickles and cream cheese"...though I guess those are pretty much the same excuse.

Why so soon? Allow me to dodge my question with a clever comment. We weren't planning on coming back so soon. If we were, we wouldn't have bought a house last year for crying out loud.

**Why Aurora? Why not Newark?**

Another excellent question (it's easy to come up with good questions when you are quizzing yourself). I work for [Rovisys](http://www.rovisys.com/), perhaps the [coolest company](http://www.wassupy.com/20061029/work/my-job-rocks/) around. Rovisys has an office near our folks so why not? I get to stay at the same, cool company and everything.

Also, we don't want to be too close. I've seen enough [Everybody Loves Raymond](http://www.everybodylovesray.com/) to know that some distance is important. We're close enough to make easy weekend trips but far enough away that unannounced drop-ins are unlikely.

**Why not Columbus?**

Why why why...what's with all the questions?! What are you four years old, Poopy-head?!

So there you go. We'll be settled in sometime in the Spring. We're very excited!

By the way, that picture is from when we moved to NC, June, 2005.
