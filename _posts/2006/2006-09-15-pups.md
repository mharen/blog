The dogs are doing fine. Pirate is an angel compared to Jane--she’s a blobby little mess most of the time. Jane is sweet when she’s tired, and cute pretty much all the time. She’s also not so fat anymore. When we initially got her (April), she had some medical issues that made her...blobby. Now that she’s healthy and on a diet, her stomach doesn’t drag on the ground and she can “sit” like a normal dog.

She’s also learned a few tricks and it getting along better with Pirate.

If we ever get her house broken, we’ll be good to go.
