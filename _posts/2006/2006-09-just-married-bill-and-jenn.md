title: 'Just Married: Bill and Jenn'
---

My older brother, Bill, got married a few months back to a great girl, Jenn. They had a great wedding and reception with lots of family, food, and fun.

A couple days ago Sarah got a birthday gift from the new couple and included in the package were some wedding photos...three CDs worth. At first I thought they might be photo CDs with just a couple dozen pics on each. Boy was I wrong. I just uploaded a solid 1.5 GB of photos to [my gallery](http://www.wassupy.com/gallery2/v/WeddingBillJenn/). Jenn had so many people with cameras at some points that it looks like a multi-angle flip book if you go through them quickly.
