  toilet seat'

![mouse.jpg](/assets/2006/mouse.jpg)I have heard this phrase [over](http://www.realtechnews.com/posts/2933) and [over](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifehack/average-desk-harbors-400-times-more-bacteria-than-average-toilet-seat.html) and [over](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/08/13/toilet_filthy/) and [over](http://www.wellnessjunction.com/athome/disease_prevention/gerba.htm) again. [Mythbusters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MythBusters_%28season_1%29#Toothbrush_Surprise) even did a show slightly related to this.

Now we have a [mouse](http://www.lewispr.com/us/wire/index.php?news_id=1915) designed to tackle this "problem". Work with me here...if you clean your bathroom regularly (or even occasionally!), but rarely clean your desk, which do you expect to be cleaner?



	* **Here's an idea: clean your desk.**




This just in: recently washed stuff is cleaner than unwashed stuff! Holy crap!

Just to take this to an obscene extreme, I took the liberty of creating a headline generator. Fill in the blanks and click "Surprise Me".

A number: <input id="toiletNumber" size="4" title="a number" type="text" value="538" /> and an object: <input id="toiletObject" size="6" title="object" type="text" value="banana" /> and <input type="button" value="Surprise Me" />
