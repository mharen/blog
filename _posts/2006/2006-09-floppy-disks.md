title: Floppy Disks

![floppydiskguy.jpg](floppydiskguy.jpg)Sarah’s school gave her a class list for her computer-based grade-book software on a 3.5” floppy disk. Holy crap! I haven’t seen one in quite a while. I had to pop the disk into my Linux server (in the garage) to read it—we don’t have a floppy drive in the house.

Fortunately, Linux is sweet and let me mount the disk remotely and copy the files over. That is, after I wiped away the cobwebs. No joke—there were cobwebs on the floppy drive! I’m actually surprised that it worked at all. I can just imagine what the Linux kernel was thinking… “whoa? You want to mount /dev/fda0? What the hell is that? Oh right, right, a floppy disk. I didn’t even know I had one of those things installed…”

I snagged that image from [Google Image Search](http://images.google.com/images?svnum=10&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=floppy+disk&amp;btnG=Search).
