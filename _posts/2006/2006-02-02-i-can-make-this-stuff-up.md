title: I can't make this stuff up
---

Evidently, a Louisiana man is [suing Apple](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/1110AP_Apple_iPod_Lawsuit.html) because his iPod *could* cause hearing loss. You have got to be freaking kidding me. He is not claiming to have *sustained* hearing loss, but he *could* sustain hearing loss.

Apple iPods already come with a label indicating that high volume could cause permanent hearing loss--this guy justs wants *more* labels. Wow.

In other news, stoves can be hot.
