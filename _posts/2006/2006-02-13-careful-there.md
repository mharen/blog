title: Careful there...

For those of you that took my advice from the post "[Oh, you work with computers?](http://wassupy.com/?p=441)" and installed Microsoft's AntiSpyware, you should be aware that a recent update could ruin your Norton Antivirus installation. At least that's what [this article](http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2006/02/microsoft_antispyware_deleting_1.html) claims.

You will probably be fine if you wait and update your software in a few days. In any case, look through the items to be "cleaned" before you "clean" them!

If it's too late, see if the support offerred in the article helps. If not, let me know.
