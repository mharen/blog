title: Thoughts About Pudding
---

* I think pudding is capable of ending all wars and conflicts.

* I think it is weird that I can buy both refrigerated and non-refrigerated pudding.

* Cafeteria pudding usually sucks. That's because it's not real pudding.

* Low-cal pudding isn't very good either, but it will doâ€”when it comes to pudding, take what you can get.

* You can eat pudding with a spoon *or* fork. It's so versatile!

And one final random though (not related to pudding)...

* Why is it that it takes hours and hours to freeze a slice of lasagna but I can reheat the same frozen block in only 90 seconds? Come on!
