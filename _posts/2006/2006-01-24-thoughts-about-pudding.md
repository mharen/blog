title: Thoughts About Pudding
---

<ul><li>I think pudding is capable of ending all wars and conflicts.</li>

<li>I think it is weird that I can buy both refrigerated and non-refrigerated pudding.</li>

<li>Cafeteria pudding usually sucks. That's because it's not real pudding.</li>

<li>Low-cal pudding isn't very good either, but it will doâ€”when it comes to pudding, take what you can get.</li>

<li>You can eat pudding with a spoon *or* fork. It's so versatile!</li></ul>

And one final random though (not related to pudding)...

<ul>

	<li>Why is it that it takes hours and hours to freeze a slice of lasagna but I can reheat the same frozen block in only 90 seconds? Come on!</li>

</ul>
