title: finals and winter, what a combination
---

Finals are heating (lol) up tomorrow. As you might have noticed, I've got a countdown going to the end of Winter Quarter. Special thanks to Dave for the pic. I think it well represents everyone's feelings (everyone that goes to a school that doesn't close for such things like 3 inches of snowfall, that is).

One final realization, now that I'm 21, I am legally allowed to celebrate St. Patrick's Day. Woohoo.

Good luck on finals, everyone, and enjoy break.
