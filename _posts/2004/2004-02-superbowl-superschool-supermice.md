Superbowl.

Wow. Good game. I can't help but thinking of the Jackson Family History when J. Jackson exposes herself to a pg-rated crowd. And in all the interviews, after they ask her the standard "so you flashed america on network television questions", they always followup with "how's michael doing?". Well, I don't know the guy but I think I could answer that one. Oh man i just deleted a really bad joke. It was really bad. Think of a really bad joke you heard recently that made you laugh so hard you cried. Yep-- it was badder than that. I had to erase to keep things civil.

SuperSchool.

Man let me tell you, school is something else.  School can drive you crazy. I'm looking back at my highschool days and thinking of those people who didn't want to go to college. I didn't understand but  man, now I see their point.

Don't get me wrong, though, college is very important and definately worth it (i expect) but it's tough.  Unless you're a business major. Just to graduate on time Sarah and Shelley are taking 22 hours next quarter! That's almost double the minimum for full time. They actually had to call to get permission to do this.

Along the same lines, I have 7 class that total 16 credit hours. WTF? So i'm taking a measly 16 hours...which translates to 1/2 dozen classes. I'm confused.

Anyway, to summarize, Shelley and Sarah study all time. I study less than I should but more than I'd like to, and no one has time for video games or movies. Aye!

I also see things on the news like some immigrants sailing accross the ocean in a 50 year old car (see pic) and i remind myself that school is probably my best bet. But again, I wonder. i'm an engineering student and I think, damn, how'd they get that car to sail?

SuperMice

Our house is infested with mice. Now at first, a mouse here and there is ok. Stuart Little needs a home, too, you know. But now the fury fuckers are eating our food and running around our entire house. The landlard (Pella) tells me that having laid out poison bait traps, the mice are now more visible because they are sick. I guess they just want some help, "Hey you! Yeah you! I'm dying and I'll show it by scaring everyone and eating all your food! MUAHAHAHAHA".

Though, this can't be all talk--some of them must be dying-- because there is an AWFUL smell to our house anytime the furnace comes on. Yay. Pella's response to that was "ewwwww, i'll call you back". Still waiting for that call....

To summarize recent events, the superbowl wasn't so super, superschool isn't so super, and supermice eat a lot and smell bad when they die in your walls. And the landlard (pella, pellaco.com) doesn't care. But hey! It's sunny outside (and 4F degrees).
