title: workin' in a coal mine...er...electrical supply company
---

*By Sarah*

since michael hasn't updated ya'll in a while, i thought i would take it upon myself to fill you in on what's going on in good old kent/akron/aurora.  

michael, like he said before, is at a computer company.  he does computer stuff that i don't really understand, and has done some major revamping of one of the company websites (yay michael!).  

i found a job through a temp agency with an electrical supply company in akron as a secretary.  what is an electrical supply company, you may ask.  well, we are the middle-middle-middle man.  as far as i can tell, this is how it goes: the manufacturer makes a product (for instance, a lightbulb).  they sell it to a company who then sells it to us (yay!)  we then sell the product to our customer, a contractor, who turns around and sells it to their customer.  cutting out the middle man in this chain would take a lot of work :P.

on a more exciting note, it's almost my birthday, which means.....I'M ALMOST 21!!!  YAY!!!'

2 weeks after my birthday, shelley turns 21!  yay!!!  :)

in other news, geronimo (hamster, see previous update) is doing well.  he tries to escape nightly, but michael and i have thus far been able to foil his plans.  he loves cheerios, and can eat up to 6 in one sitting (pretty impressive for an animal who is about the size of a donut hole).  we will get pics up soon, hopefully.

i hope everyone is doing well!  talk to you all soon!
