title: Building a Prettier Search Box
---


Note: if youâ€™re reading this off-site (feed reader, facebook, etc.) and it looks funny, click through for a better view.

Let's take a quick look at a typical search box:
<blockquote> 

<input /><input type="submit" />
</blockquote>

It's boring, plain, and takes up a lot of space. But, the code is about as simple as it gets:
<blockquote>   <pre class="csharpcode"><span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">input</span> <span class="kwrd">/&gt;

&lt;</span><span class="html">input</span> <span class="attr">type</span><span class="kwrd">=&quot;submit&quot;</span> <span class="kwrd">/&gt;

</span></pre>
</blockquote>


We can improve things a great deal by adding a shiny graphic:

<blockquote>


<input /><input src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_IKD9WtY5kxU/TMJXvFRpXzI/AAAAAAAABG4/DU79z1bP4WU/search.gif" type="image" />
</blockquote>


That's most easily accomplished by changing the input type from &quot;submit&quot; to &quot;image&quot; like so (this could be accomplished in CSS with a bit [more effort](http://stackoverflow.com/q/195632/29)): 

<blockquote>
  <pre class="csharpcode"><span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">input</span> <span class="kwrd">/&gt;

&lt;</span><span class="html">input</span> <span class="attr">src</span><span class="kwrd">=&quot;search.gif&quot;</span> <span class="attr">type</span><span class="kwrd">=&quot;image&quot;</span> <span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span></pre>
</blockquote>


Now we're talking. Let's go a little further:

<blockquote>


<input class="post-example-input" /><input class="post-example-go" src="http://www.bing.com/siteowner/s/siteowner/Spyglass_16x16.gif" type="image" />
</blockquote>


Here we've overlaid the image with the box for a very clean effect. This uses the same HTML (I just added classes) but adds just a teenie bit of CSS:

<blockquote>
  <pre class="csharpcode"><span class="rem">/* overlay search button on the actual box */</span>
input.search-button { position:relative; left: -20px; top:1px } 

<span class="rem">/* pad out the input so a user's search won't go under the search button */</span>
input.search-box { padding-right:20px; }</pre>
</blockquote>


Clean and simple. 


It has one minor drawback in that it doesn't support CSS sprites. If you want that, you'll need to use one of the <code>background-image</code> tricks at the [link](http://stackoverflow.com/q/195632/29) I mentioned earlier.


Of course once Google's Instant Search sweeps the web this will all be a cow's opinion: moo.
