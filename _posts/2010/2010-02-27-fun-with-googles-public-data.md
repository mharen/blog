title: "Fun with Google's Public Data"
---


I was going to do a post about our world’s exploding population growth and stumbled upon Google’s awesome [public data service](http://www.google.com/publicdata?ds=wb-wdi&met=sp_pop_totl&q=world+population#met=sp_pop_totl&idim=country:USA:GBR:JPN:DEU:CAN:MEX:RUS:VNM) with my first research query:

I haven’t been able to uncover an index for what types of things you can show here but a little [searching](http://www.google.com/search?q=site:http://www.google.com/publicdata+co2) will get you other things.

Anyway, so this is what I was looking for initially ([data source](http://www.vaughns-1-pagers.com/history/world-population-growth.htm)):

And since the last 200 years:

Clearly my source data could be more complete. Even with the gaps, though, the exploding trend is obvious. It comes with this neat, mind-blowing factoid, too:
<blockquote> 

The total number of humans that have **ever lived</b> has been estimated at <b>110 billion</b>.      

<b>Approximately 6% of all those people are alive today.**
</blockquote>

*Wow*. With the modern improvements to [life expectancy](http://www.google.com/publicdata?ds=wb-wdi&q=lifespan#met=sp_dyn_le00_in&tdim=true) and high rate of population growth ([15 years per billion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_population_growth_-_time_between_each_billion-person_growth.jpg)), it might be a while before this 6% figure stabilizes (i.e. stops growing). 

I’m not suggesting that this is a bad thing—not at all. I just find it interesting.
