title: Why Twitter is Awesome
---


I don’t understand Twitter—how it works, how it makes money, or anything. As a computer engineer, I marvel at how impressive it is in terms of scale. For example, they are now crunching [50,000,000 tweets per day](http://mashable.com/2010/02/22/twitter-50-million-tweets/). That’s incredible.

Volume doesn’t make it awesome, though. Most of those tweets are about what uninteresting people are eating, watching, etc. Here’s why it’s awesome: I am empowered to connect with people in otherwise unreachable places. This calls for some examples:  <h4>Example 1: Microsoft</h4>

I recently ranted a bit about Visual Studio 2010 RC crashes:
<blockquote> 

If you crash on me one more damn time, VS2010, I will drop kick you onto the roof of my building. I'm not even kidding. [9:58 PM Feb 24th](http://twitter.com/mharen/status/9607164906)  

It's official, VS2010 is getting taped to a ball and kicked onto the roof of my office tomorrow. Hope you're happy...(I warned you). [10:59 PM Feb 24th](http://twitter.com/mharen/status/9609708666)
</blockquote>

This brought a very nice reply from someone I’ve never heard of (@Pilchie):
<blockquote> 

@mharen: Are you using a touch screen? Seen [http://bit.ly/dlT7ez](http://bit.ly/dlT7ez) ? [11:09 PM Feb 24th](http://twitter.com/Pilchie/status/9610121141)&#160;
</blockquote>

It turns out that @Pilchie is “Dev Lead for C# IntelliSense/Refactoring/etc at Microsoft”. Well how about that? In a mere 10 minutes, I was getting help from not just Microsoft, but the guy who works on the product I was complaining about. And his link worked!  <h4>Example 2: Stackoverflow/Codinghorror</h4>

I was working on a project which is using a lot of the same libraries that Stackoverflow uses. I ran into trouble with one of the components: I couldn’t figure out which version to use. So I pinged the lead developer/co-creator of SO:
<blockquote> 

@[codinghorror](http://twitter.com/codinghorror) where do i get the best wmd editor for use with markdownsharp? your version on google code? [7:30 PM Feb 8th](http://twitter.com/mharen/status/8832078048)
</blockquote>

And his very prompt response:
<blockquote> 

r @[mharen](http://twitter.com/mharen) our version is on Google Code, or you can dig through the fork-splosion on github and try to guess which version is "best" [7:33 PM Feb 8th](http://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/8832188858)
</blockquote>

In ***three*** minutes I had my answer from the top guy of the a product that’s used by bajillions (if not gajillions) of people. Even if he hadn’t answered, I was hoping that someone else might (this wasn’t a private query).  <h4>Example 3: Red Gate’s Neil Davidson</h4>

Via Twitter, I discovered a neat little book on software pricing. I tweeted about it:
<blockquote> 

40% in and still interesting... RT @[spolsky](http://twitter.com/spolsky): A short ebook about software product pricing [http://retwt.me/1bmXM](http://retwt.me/1bmXM) (from @[neildavidson](http://twitter.com/neildavidson)) [9:10 AM Nov 3rd, 2009](http://twitter.com/mharen/status/5391952110)
</blockquote>

A half-hour later, I see this in my feed:
<blockquote> 

@[mharen](http://twitter.com/mharen) Glad you're liking the eBook! If you have time, could you post a review on Amazon once you've finished? ( [http://bit.ly/18xFJx)](http://bit.ly/18xFJx))&#160;[9:37 AM Nov 3rd, 2009](http://twitter.com/NeilDavidson/status/5392536276)
</blockquote>

It’s at this point that I realize who wrote the book: [Neil Davidson](http://www.neildavidson.com/), co-founder/joint CEO of [Red Gate Software](http://www.red-gate.com/), and founder&#160; of the [Business of Software conferences](http://blog.businessofsoftware.org/) among other things. A cool guy to get to know, no doubt. I finished the book and left a review as he asked and took the opportunity to ask about one of his products:
<blockquote> 

@[NeilDavidson](http://twitter.com/NeilDavidson) you bet; we use a lot of your products btw--thanks! What's up with Log Rescue not supporting SQL >2000? Anything planned? [9:40 AM Nov 3rd, 2009](http://twitter.com/mharen/status/5392617100)
</blockquote>

To which I got a very simple and candid reply (the beauty of the 140 character limit!):
<blockquote> 

@[mharen](http://twitter.com/mharen) We're not going to do any more work on SQL Log Rescue. Lots of people used it, but nobody bought, and SQL 2000 work would be huge [9:42 AM Nov 3rd, 2009](http://twitter.com/NeilDavidson/status/5392660455)
</blockquote>  <hr />

It’s so cool that this simple medium enables and promotes these types of quick conversations. In 2/3 of these cases, I wasn’t even trying to initiate communication—others were listening for certain things and *they found me*. 

When I first starting toying with Twitter it seemed that its signal-to-noise ratio was cripplingly low. Now I see that by following keywords—not users—the signal is strong.

It also has a unique ability to cut through the BS by forcing you to choose your words carefully. I like that.

Crazy.  It's like you're famous or something :)
