If you like smart stuff you will love TED Talks. I have watched dozens of these over the last couple of years and have never been disappointed. I tend to focus on tech or UI related talks like anything from [Hans Rosling](http://www.ted.com/speakers/hans_rosling.html) (he is a fantastic presenter, too):

Another one of my favorites is an [incredible demo](http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/blaise_aguera.html) of some tech coming out of Microsoft, presented by Blaise Aguera y Arcas:  

 

There are also random ones that don’t seem to have as much of a point to them but are utterly hilarious, like [this presentation](http://www.ted.com/talks/ze_frank_s_nerdcore_comedy.html) by Ze Frank:
