I checked the tools *I use *and discovered this Easter egg in [SQL Compare](http://www.red-gate.com/Products/SQL_Compare/index.htm) and [Data Compare](http://www.red-gate.com/Products/SQL_Data_Compare/index.htm) (v7.1):

Which, after a few seconds, turns into one of those annoying slider puzzles:

Fun stuff!
