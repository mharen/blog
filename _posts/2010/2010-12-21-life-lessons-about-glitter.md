title: "Life Lessons About Glitter (ZOMG IT'S EVERYWHERE)"
---


A week or so back Wife and I were cleaning upstairs while the kiddos dumped out all their toys in the basement. A typical Tuesday. Of course we check on them often and on my rounds I discovered this:

![glitter 1[6].jpg](/assets/2010/glitter 1[6].jpg)

In case it’s not immediately obvious, the kids got into an industrial supply of glitter and went. to. town. Here’s the same photo marked up where we found (and can still find) this horrible, horrible stuff:

Astute readers will note substantial collections in shoes, and all over Thing2. What’s most unfortunate is where the glitter is *not*: in its glitter containers (not marked, but scattered throughout) or in the two *giant, wide-open* baskets designated for such activities.

To appreciate the gravity of this you must understand that I h-a-t-e glitter. Passionately. If an organization existed with the sole objective of outlawing glitter, I would donate both time and money to the cause.   

  

(jump to 3:00) 

Upon discovering the horror in my basement, I uttered a single expletive, followed by the undo code “peanutbutter” to wipe it from the children’s memory and immediately commanded wife to stay upstairs and ignore the preceding commotion. Obviously that didn’t work as I have no such power. Thing1 was lucky to hit the sweet spot on the shock curve:

Don’t get me wrong—we made her (help) clean it up and that led to a lot of tears—but I really wasn’t as angry with this whole situation as I would have predicted. That’s the life lesson, I guess. After replacing the upstairs carpet because of the great [paint-everywhere-even-on-the-dog-omg-are-you-kidding](http://footedjammies.blogspot.com/2010/04/our-day-in-pictures.html) incident of 2010 (featured on [shitmykidsruined.com](http://www.shitmykidsruined.com/2010/05/14/acrylic-paint/)), a bucket of glitter’s just not so bad.    

But glitter is **banned** from my home. I’m not a fool.

If you're curious about what's up with Thing1's pants...

I crudely shopped them in as she wasn't actually wearing any. If that seems strange to you, you must not have kids--I assure you, it's common.

Very funny :)  I'm so glad you blogged about this, because my version would have been much less amusing!

This is TOO funny!  I needed this, this morning!  :)

Definitely made me laugh out loud and I'm sorry because I said at library today, "maya, maybe you can decorate your sled with some glitter after you get home!" Don't worry, Sarah corrected me and Maya told me you don't have glitter anymore! Now I understand why...Ha ha!
