I checked the tools *I use *and discovered this Easter egg in [SQL Compare](http://www.red-gate.com/Products/SQL_Compare/index.htm) and [Data Compare](http://www.red-gate.com/Products/SQL_Data_Compare/index.htm) (v7.1):

Fun stuff!

Why would I want that? I love Redgate and they deserve to be paid for their software.
