[TED](http://www.ted.com/) [is](http://www.ted.com/pages/view/id/5):

> ... a small nonprofit devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. It started out (in 1984) as a conference bringing together people from three worlds: **Technology, Entertainment, Design.**

If you like smart stuff you will love TED Talks. I have watched dozens of these over the last couple of years and have never been disappointed. I tend to focus on tech or UI related talks like anything from [Hans Rosling](http://www.ted.com/speakers/hans_rosling.html) (he is a fantastic presenter, too):

Another one of my favorites is an [incredible demo](https://www.ted.com/talks/blaise_aguera_y_arcas_how_photosynth_can_connect_the_world_s_images) of some tech coming out of Microsoft, presented by Blaise Aguera y Arcas:

There are also random ones that donâ€™t seem to have as much of a point to them but are utterly hilarious, like [this presentation](https://www.ted.com/talks/ze_frank_nerdcore_comedy) by Ze Frank:
