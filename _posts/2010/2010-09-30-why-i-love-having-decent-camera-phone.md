title: Why I love Having a Decent Camera Phone
---

Without my camera phone (Droid Incredible), I would not have captured any of these images.

Thing1 enjoying her second day of school, playing with a mirror, and occasionally sleeping:

![maya and mirror]({{ "/assets/2010/camera-phone-00009.jpg" | relative_url }})

![maya sleeps]({{ "/assets/2010/camera-phone-00010.jpg" | relative_url }})

Thing1 and Thing2 being awesome (typical) and getting along (rare):

![kids at mall]({{ "/assets/2010/camera-phone-00005.jpg" | relative_url }})

![kids at mall]({{ "/assets/2010/camera-phone-00006.jpg" | relative_url }})

![kids dancing or something]({{ "/assets/2010/camera-phone-00007.jpg" | relative_url }})

A neat toaster and cool window at the airport in Philidelpha or Albany (can't remember which):

![sweeet toaster]({{ "/assets/2010/camera-phone-00003.jpg" | relative_url }})

![neat window]({{ "/assets/2010/camera-phone-00004.jpg" | relative_url }})

A Blues Bros. staging area:

![police cars]({{ "/assets/2010/camera-phone-00011.jpg" | relative_url }})

A Mexican restaurant that has a nearly identical menu to El Campesino in NE Ohio (hmmmm):

![menu cover]({{ "/assets/2010/camera-phone-00013.jpg" | relative_url }})

![menu inside]({{ "/assets/2010/camera-phone-00012.jpg" | relative_url }})

A furniture store catering only to a certain, specific clientele (and more):

![odd furniture store name]({{ "/assets/2010/camera-phone-00014.jpg" | relative_url }})

Some probably bad advice from my rental car:

![bad advice]({{ "/assets/2010/camera-phone-00015.jpg" | relative_url }})

Some random discoveries at the drug store:

![tastey drink yum]({{ "/assets/2010/camera-phone-00016.jpg" | relative_url }})

![chewy popcorn]({{ "/assets/2010/camera-phone-00001.jpg" | relative_url }})

![awesome idea]({{ "/assets/2010/camera-phone-00017.jpg" | relative_url }})

And of course, my super sweet and very missed family:

![]({{ "/assets/2010/camera-phone-00008.jpg" | relative_url }})
