title: Why I love Having a Decent Camera Phone
---

Without my camera phone (Droid Incredible), I would not have captured any of these images.

Thing1 enjoying her second day of school, playing with a mirror, and occasionally sleeping:

{% imagesize /assets/2010/camera-phone-00009.jpg:img alt='maya and mirror' %}

{% imagesize /assets/2010/camera-phone-00010.jpg:img alt='maya sleeps' %}

Thing1 and Thing2 being awesome (typical) and getting along (rare):

{% imagesize /assets/2010/camera-phone-00005.jpg:img alt='kids at mall' %}

{% imagesize /assets/2010/camera-phone-00006.jpg:img alt='kids at mall' %}

{% imagesize /assets/2010/camera-phone-00007.jpg:img alt='kids dancing or something' %}

A neat toaster and cool window at the airport in Philidelpha or Albany (can't remember which):

{% imagesize /assets/2010/camera-phone-00003.jpg:img alt='sweeet toaster' %}

{% imagesize /assets/2010/camera-phone-00004.jpg:img alt='neat window' %}

A Blues Bros. staging area:

{% imagesize /assets/2010/camera-phone-00011.jpg:img alt='police cars' %}

A Mexican restaurant that has a nearly identical menu to El Campesino in NE Ohio (hmmmm):

{% imagesize /assets/2010/camera-phone-00013.jpg:img alt='menu cover' %}

{% imagesize /assets/2010/camera-phone-00012.jpg:img alt='menu inside' %}

A furniture store catering only to a certain, specific clientele (and more):

{% imagesize /assets/2010/camera-phone-00014.jpg:img alt='odd furniture store name' %}

Some probably bad advice from my rental car:

Some random discoveries at the drug store:

{% imagesize /assets/2010/camera-phone-00016.jpg:img alt='tastey drink yum' %}

{% imagesize /assets/2010/camera-phone-00001.jpg:img alt='chewy popcorn' %}

{% imagesize /assets/2010/camera-phone-00017.jpg:img alt='awesome idea' %}

And of course, my super sweet and very missed family:
