title: 'Ruminations: Multiple Births; Congratulations'
---


I am afraid if I ever have twins or triplets that I would try to carry too many at one time and drop one, both, all, etc. Oops!

And that's my segway into my congratulations to B+T on their new double-dose of parenthood. Here's a list of things to keep you occupied during your downtime (infants are boring):  <ul>   <li>N/A </li> </ul>

...you won't be having any of that. Sorry. Now let's [extrapolate your family](http://xkcd.com/605/):

At this rate (if my calculations are correct), the trend is slightly alarming: ![image%5B14%5D.png](/assets/2010/image%5B14%5D.png) 

Of course the total number of kids you have will be a bit more dramatic:

The only thing I can conclude from this is that you might want to refocus your house-hunting for something in the country. With lots of room.

In any case, best of luck to you and enjoy these first few weeks as a family of five! Let me know if I can help in any way (I just might).
