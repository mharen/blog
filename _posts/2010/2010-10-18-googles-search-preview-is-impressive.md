title: "Google\u2019s Search Preview Is Impressive"
---


There is no half-assing it over at Google. When they bring something to market, it’s generally a well-polished solution. Like [Search Preview](http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2010/10/google-tests-search-preview.html) which just started showing up for me. 

I noticed that search results became shaded as I hovered:

And when clicked (or if that magnifying glass is clicked), a preview image appears:

This preview shows what the site I’m about to go to looks like along with the area I’m probably interested in enlarged with my search terms highlighted. Doing this once is impressive in its own right, but doing it to scale—for millions of queries—is an incredible feat. 

Google has once again taken a feature from other sites and replaced the silly novelty of it with elegance and usefulness.
