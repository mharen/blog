title: 'Dear Children: You Are Awesome'
---

If you know me, you know that I can’t stop yammering about my kids. I won’t apologize for it: they’re great.

This occurs to me regularly. For instance, on Saturday I had the intimidating task of entertaining the kids by myself for the evening (Wife was busy). We had a great time. We didn’t do anything fancy—just wandered around the toys and Christmas decorations at Target and Lowes—but everyone was laughing and smiling and having fun.

It helped that I remembered to feed them.

*“Look Daddy! A Christmas chicken!”*

It’s not always so easy (we’re all cranky once in a while) but we’re having more and more good days as they get older and more independent. **This is my message to new parents: it’s rough early on. But it gets better, easier, and so much more fun! Hang in there!**

They start creating fun for themselves.

And doing their own things.

And sometimes they even like each other. Especially when they’re cold.

And when we’re really, really lucky they wake up so happy that you can’t help but wake up happy, too.

Happy Thanksgiving from the Harens!
