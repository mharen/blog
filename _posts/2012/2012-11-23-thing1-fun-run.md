title: Thing1's Fun Run
---

Wife and I ran the Kent Turkey Trot again this year. She placed in the top 10 for women and I finished without dying so overall we beat our goals. 

More exciting than mere survival, though was Thing1's race. She did a ~0.25 mile fun run. She was ridiculously photogenic on the way out but was moving so fast it was hard to capture her on film.

Congrats, Peanut!
