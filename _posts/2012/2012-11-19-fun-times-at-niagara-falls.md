title: Fun Times at Niagara Falls With the Kiddos
---

Wife and I first visited Niagara falls as something of a last little vacation before Thing1 was born. We’d never been and were curious what all the fuss was about. It gave us a fun story actually...

> The car broke down on the way out. We were determined, though. We were towed to a shop where we left it to be fixed and took a rental to the rest of the way. We had a great overnight trip, saw the falls, laughed, etc., and then returned to God-forsaken Youngstown to pick up the car.

Good times. Anyway, we happened to find ourselves in Canada again last month. I had an appointment at the border crossing at Niagara Falls to interview for my Nexus trusted traveler card so we had a perfect opportunity to visit again.

But now we have a gaggle of children...so it’s even better :)

They loved it!

That’s the iPhone’s native panorama. Here’s the same shot with the 360 app:

It’s fun reliving these experiences with them.

Except for the driving, they’re fun travel companions, too.

Thank God for this woman. Whenever you see my kids behaving or being cute, it’s because of her.

I don’t remember what exactly was going on here...but they’re all in one place so I probably thought that was significant enough to document it with a photo.

Happy Thanksgiving!
