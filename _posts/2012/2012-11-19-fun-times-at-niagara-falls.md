title: Fun Times at Niagara Falls With the Kiddos
---


Wife and I first visited Niagara falls as something of a last little vacation before Thing1 was born. We’d never been and were curious what all the fuss was about. It gave us a fun story actually…
<blockquote> 

The car broke down on the way out. We were determined, though. We were towed to a shop where we left it to be fixed and took a rental to the rest of the way. We had a great overnight trip, saw the falls, laughed, etc., and then returned to God-forsaken Youngstown to pick up the car.
</blockquote>

Good times. Anyway, we happened to find ourselves in Canada again last month. I had an appointment at the border crossing at Niagara Falls to interview for my Nexus trusted traveler card so we had a perfect opportunity to visit again.

But now we have a gaggle of children…so it’s even better :)

They loved it!  ![07-2012-10-26%2015.55.37%5B2%5D.jpg](07-2012-10-26%2015.55.37%5B2%5D.jpg) 

That’s the iPhone’s native panorama. Here’s the same shot with the 360 app:  <div style="text-align: center;"></div>

It’s fun reliving these experiences with them.  <hr />

Except for the driving, they’re fun travel companions, too.

Thank God for this woman. Whenever you see my kids behaving or being cute, it’s because of her.

I don’t remember what exactly was going on here…but they’re all in one place so I probably thought that was significant enough to document it with a photo.

Happy Thanksgiving!
