title: Happy First Birthday, Thing 3
---

Thing 3’s birthday is today. It’s hard to believe it’s already been a year since [he was born](../../2011/08/birth-story-thing-3.html).

Although babies are cute and snuggly, I enjoy raising kids even more when they start to interact more purposefully. He’s almost there. He has a couple words, he can take a couple steps, and he’s becoming more expressive every day.

Needless to say, I’m excited for the times my son and I will share together. Since I have so many fond memories of growing up working with my dad on handyman-related things, Wife thought I could make him a tool bench as a present (or maybe she’s just spending too much time on Pinterest, where she [got the idea](http://pinterest.com/pin/184577284698686013/)).

The gist of the project was to refurbish a piece of furniture into a children’s toy (this helps to make up for my lack of cabinetry skills). We went to the [Habitat for Humanity ReStore](http://www.habitat.org/restores/default.aspx) and discovered a pretty amazing place for construction materials and furniture. This place was a lot more than I expected.

We found what we needed:

The girls helped me scuff of the surface for priming and painting:

Then we wiped it down and repaired a broken drawer:

I primed it with Kilz 2 Latex primer and then applied a single coat of a greyish paint we found in the basement.

I cut a section of pegboard for the back from a 2’x4’ section I bought at Lowes. I also bought a paint sample (~8 oz.) mixed to just slightly darker than regular red. This was for the drawer front and peg board so I didn’t need much.

After painting, the girls helped me attach the draw slides and peg board (tip: tapping the screws with a drill first, then letting the kids help with a manual driver makes for good fun)

And it’s finished! I dug up some old pegboard hooks which fit the toolset Wife bought pretty well:

Love the tool bench! You're a great dad!

Very cool. I can't wait until I have the tools and space for doing stuff like this. I like this a lot better, in terms of creativity and durability, than just buying a cheap plastic one from a kids' store.
