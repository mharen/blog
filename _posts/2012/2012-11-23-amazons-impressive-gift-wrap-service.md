title: How I Discovered Amazon's Impressive Gift Wrap Service Via a Generous Friend
---

I received an unexpected package today from Amazon. Hmmm...

I opened it and started to get excited. It wasn’t what I usually get from Amazon (batteries, pink toys, etc.).

It turns out that my friend Mark sent me a birthday present! Woot! I was very impressed by the presentation. Each item had a fancy wrapping, a fancy ribbon, and a fancy card.

I guess I’m known for my fruity shirts. 

The gifts are perfect, and they arrived like a sir.

I’m actually shocked the kids adapted so quickly to it all. Thing 1, and Uncle Chris:

Thanks, Mark! I’ve got some learnin’ to do.

Some day I’ll remember to give you your Christmas present from last year.

I'm surprised by how much I love the horse mask.  I just wish I could wear it long enough without laughing to actually be funny!
