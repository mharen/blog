Vote. 

When will you vote? Specifically…what time? What will you be doing before you vote? Apparently thinking about this in advance [might increase](http://www.npr.org/2012/07/16/156571493/can-science-plant-brain-seeds-that-make-you-vote) the chance that you will actually do it.

It’s important and I suggest you [plan ahead](https://www.google.com/elections/ed/us/vote).

Vote for progress. Vote for rights. Vote for the rights of others.
