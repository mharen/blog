title: Searching in Outlook
---

![outlook-icon.jpg](outlook-icon.jpg)Love it or hate it, Outlook is *the *email solution for a lot of people. When it comes to work-related email, I'm one of those suckers.

Now that Google has spoiled us with archive-and-search-everything email, I've run into issues with my enormous work inbox. I have mimicked by gmail setup in Outlook with the aid of the fantastic search tool Lookout.

Lookout was acquired by MS a few years ago but was apparantly discarded. More on that from [Joel Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/12/24.html). The original author clearly explained how to [obtain](http://www.majorgeeks.com/Lookout_d4808.html) and [configure Lookout for Outlook 2007](http://www.belshe.com/2007/12/06/how-to-install-lookout-on-outlook-2007/).

If you're stuck with Outlook, consider this free tool to make searches quick and easy.

One final tip: if you are using Outlook 2007 and hate that annoying "Click here to enable lame instant search" nag bar, fear not. This is how to disable it:



&nbsp;

<ul>

	<li>Tools &gt; Options &gt; Other &gt; Advanced Options</li>

	<li>Uncheck "Show prompts to enable lame InstantSearch"</li>

</ul>
