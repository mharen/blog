I snapped this headline back in January and am just now getting around to posting it:

There is no doubt that times are tough and the credit market is a mess but a bloodbath? No. Newspaper man: you can't open with a headline like this and then not deliver. I can't [follow your story](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVcyPPAwoGA) with gross exaggerations like that.

In attempting to find the source I snapped that pic from, I discovered that I'm not the only [one](http://www.upstateforums.com/phpBB2/viewtopic,p,67840.html#67840) [who](http://bankergirl.com/archives/55) [picked](http://www.scsv.nevada.edu/~anzalone/blog2/archives/000196.html) [up](http://destrukto.livejournal.com/296626.html) on this. As others have noted this seems to have originated as an MSNMoney article that still exists in [some outlets](http://finance.ingter.net/content/view/400/1/). However, the original story has a [new headline](http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/Dispatch/080122markets.aspx) (but is still the top search result for the bloodbath lineâ€”go Google!).
