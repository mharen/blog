title: 'Idea: Blackmail Yourself to Health'

It’s no secret that [most of us](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=median+US+BMI" target="_blank) are overweight. I don’t think I’m going out on a limb by suggesting that *motivation *to eat better and work out more is the biggest issue. I just had a potentially evil idea for motivating people like me: blackmail yourself.

Suppose you had an app (e.g. a Facebook app) that recorded your “before” stats. This would capture a simple measurement like weight or BMI and (most importantly) an unflattering “before” picture of yourself. This would be like the first weigh in of *The Biggest Loser* except **it’d all be private to you.**

At first.

The trick would be that as long **as you continue **to post progress each week in the form of an updated picture, updated stats, or workout summaries, **things would stay private**. But** if you get complacent, your most recent stats would be automatically leaked** to your wall for all your friends to see.

If you simply keep up with your plan, eventually you’ll get to post one of those sweet “after” shots (if you want).

I can even see a *Back To The Future* style leak where only part of the image comes into focus at first as a warning. There’s seemingly endless potential for more social aspects, too, including *positive support*.

So is this the worst idea ever? Genius? Been done already? Personally this would encourage me to hit the gym more often and pour less syrup on my waffles.
