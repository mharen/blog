title: The End Of Super Bowl-Style Advertising
---

I’m sure I’m late to this party but here it goes for those just arriving with me: the era of the big Super Bowl commercial is over. I’d like to enter into evidence exhibit A, a tweet from my coworker:  

![a tweet from @jaredforshey on Feb 6, 2011 that reads "In the age of youtube and everyone-is- the-creator-ism, 'funny commercials' just aren't compelling to me."]({{ "/assets/2011/super-bowl-11.png" | relative_url }})

He nailed it. When I have access to unlimited amusing clips (usually with no ulterior motive), watching a three hour football game is hardly an efficient delivery mechanism for untested, untargeted clips designed to manipulate me.

Sure I chuckled at several of them, including this favorite that I’m sure you’ve seen 800 times already:

And this close runner-up:

But those professionally produced, multi-million-dollar barely match up to what Youtubers put together. [Need I remind you](../../2010/11/arduino-day-6-analog-inputs)? 

But what about actual advertising? I for one welcome our ad-targeting, crowd-sourced robot overlords and judging from yesterday’s performance, the sooner they arrive the better.
