title: How Do I Print [this web page]!?
---

### TL;DR:

Press `ctrl-p` (in every browser ever made).

### But But But...

Where's my "print" link? Print links are about a million years old in Internet years. They were needed back in the day when technology couldn't easily produce "printer-friendly versions" of pages without doing server-side voodoo magic. Things have been different *for years*, though, and separate print pages are no longer necessary. 

### But I still want one!

No.

### But this other, cooler site has one!

Odds are, their "print" button just calls "window.print()" which is just short hand code for, "you're an idiot and shouldn't be trusted with electricity".

Hey, don't get upset with me, I'm just translating.
