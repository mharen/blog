title: Statistics are Misleading At Best, Filthy Liars at Second Best
---


Back in April, I somehow came across [this site](http://disruptthenarrative.wordpress.com/2011/04/24/gas-pump-activism/) blaming President Obama for raging gas prices:

The implication is that since the moment Obama took office, gas prices have gone crazy. My god! 

Wait wait wait…why the steep decline at the end of 2008? Let’s uncrop a bit (I downloaded some public data from an energy gov site, dropped it into Excel, and annotated it with SnagIt):

That’s a pretty different picture, isn’t it? 

I’m not posting this to indict or vindicate anyone. I’m not even going to guess at explanations for the dramatic changes in that chart. I only post this to encourage people to be skeptical of charts, and to be especially suspicious of sensationalism.

Oh, and if you hate paying $3-4 dollars/gallon in the United States…[it could be worse](../../2005/09/gas-prices.html).

Here's an extreme example of nonsense line charts that I got in the mail:

What exactly is that chart showing?! It's skipping a lot of years there...
