title: How to Cook Bacon on a George Foreman Grill

Place strips of bacon on hot grill:

Burn grill marks into bacon, without cooking evenly.

Eat bacon anyway.

Never try cooking bacon this way again.

(Note: this was attempted for convenience, not in a doomed attempt to make bacon healthier.)

You forgot to mention to make sure not to burn your foot on the grill like Micheal Scott- 

&quot;I enjoy having breakfast in bed. I like waking up to the smell of bacon- sue me- and since I don''t have a butler, I have to do it myself. So most nights before I go to bed I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill. Then I go to sleep. When I wake up, I plug in the grill. I go back to sleep again. Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon. It is delicious. It''s good for me. It's the perfect way to start the day. Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot. That''s it. I don't see what's so hard to believe about that&quot;

Good advice, and no worries on the spelling.
