title: 'Blurry Shapes: Unleashing the Bokeh'
---

While browsing the excellent photography Stack Exchange site and learning lots about [bokeh](http://photo.stackexchange.com/q/2706/380#2710), I came across the [awesome idea](http://www.diyphotography.net/diy_create_your_own_bokeh) that led to this shot:

The effect here is in the Christmas lights—they’re regular lights—and by adding this lens filter, stuff that’s normally blurry goes crazy:

With this in place, the image on the left turns into the image on the right (similar focus distance):

Cool post, honey :)  Sorry about my super photography knowledge stealing your thunder.  You probably now know how I feel about every other thing in the world that is not directly related to babies, music or photography (and some things that are).
