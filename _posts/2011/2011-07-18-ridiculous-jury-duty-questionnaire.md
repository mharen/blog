title: A Ridiculous Jury Duty Questionnaire
---

A while back I got a jury duty notice. A couple weeks before I was due to appear I received a huge questionnaire in the mail. This thing was more comprehensive than everything Wife and I did for premarital counseling. Over 100 questions.

After I sent this in, but before I had to appear the case was continued so I never appeared. With that in mind, and because no one told me not to, I’d like to share some select answers.

Before you think I’m just cherry-picking questions, I’m not. This thing was personal:

That covered my detailed family history, religion, politics, career, salary, parenting, education, etc. Yikes!

Here are some of my favorite answers:

Once I even did computer stuff *at* a pizza place.

Wife compelled me to *not attach* a list describing her job.

(Before you assume I hate authority, check out questions 96-98 farther down.)

And finally, after nearly eight years, the secret to my lasting marriage is revealed in question 102.

As a genuinely curious person, with a strong sense of civic duty, I was sincerely disappointed that this fizzled out as quickly as it did. I’ve seen *12 Angry Men* and tons of *Law and Order* so I’m basically an expert.
