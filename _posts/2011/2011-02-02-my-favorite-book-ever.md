title: My Favorite Book Ever
---

My favorite book ever isn’t a book. It’s a Kindle.

I came to this party late and unwilling, like I do to most social occasions. Except I’m usually awkwardly early to social occasions. I received my Kindle 3 Wi-Fi as a Christmas gift (thanks, Mom) and knocked out my first book in just a few days.

After two weeks, I’d read three books. In the weeks since, I’ve read three more: 

* *The Confession* by John Grisham
* *The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo* by Stieg Larrsson
* *The Girl Who Played with Fire* by Stieg Larrsson
* *The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets’ Nest* by Stieg Larrsson
* *The Help* by Kathryn Stockett
* *The Hunger Games* by Suzanne Collins 

I voraciously tore through and enjoyed each one. 

Six books is more than I’ve read in as many years. Why the sudden change? Initially it was the down-time of the holidays; we had a lot of help with our little ones so I could indulge in such things. Some of it is that this thing is so lightweight that I can, with my cover’s built in book-light, read in bed regularly. A good chunk is that I can read it on the elliptical machine at the gym by cranking up the font size a notch or two. And finally, it’s just so damn easy to use **in a way that even paper isn’t** that I can’t help but tap turn-turn-turn.

This all took me by surprise. Big time. If you’re on the fence w.r.t. taking the plunge on an e-reader, I suggest diving in. You’ll be in good company.
