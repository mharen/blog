Well my friends, the second intramural hockey season is starting up. This time around, we're all playing D-League. Basically, D-League requires no skating ability, doesn't enforce offsides or icing, and uses mandatory line changes. In fact, the ability to skate is a big plus.

I'll be sure to keep you up to date.

Hopefully I'll have some humorous posts on the way and less of this blah blah blah.
