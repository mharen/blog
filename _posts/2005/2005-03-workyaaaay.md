title: Work...yaaaay!

I'm not sure of a good leadin to this so here it goes: I just received an offer for a full time job in NC! This is a huge load off. Sarah and I had started getting a little stressed and this is just such a relief. I'd calculated that we could survive until October if I didn't find a job...and we didn't eat. Fortunately, now we don't have to worry about :)

I'll very likely be working for RoviSys doing systems engineering stuff. RoviSys is the sweet company I worked for last summer and have been doing a little stuff now and then for them since then. Yay!
