A friend just passed on the news that Microsoft has aquired a spyware-squashing company and is now releasing their software for free. The word is that it's very good. If you have spyware/adware/popup problems, [try it out](http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/spyware/software/default.mspx). I haven't used it so I can't add my $.02 but as my friend says, "it's got the MS 'blessing' so-to-speak."
