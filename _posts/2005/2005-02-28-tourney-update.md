A quick update on the tourney:

I've got 15 definates and 7 maybes.

Friday, 3/4/05 @ 8:30

Details: Buyin is $5. This will give you 200 in chips. During the first hour, you can rebuy if you bust out or refill as many times as you want for $3 (120 in chips). You can only refill up to 120 chips, but you can do this as many times as you want. For example, if Johnny busts out 5 minutes into the tourney to lose all his chips, he can get 120 more for $3. If Ricky loses all but 20 chips 40 minutes into the tourney, he can buy 80 more to bring him up to 120 chips for (in this case) $2.

Blinds will go up every 30 minutes and we'll shuffle tables every hour.

Blinds: 1/2, 2/4, 4/8, 5/10, 10/15, 10/20, 15/30, 20/40, 25/50, 30/60, 40/80, 50/100

Let me know if you have any questions!
