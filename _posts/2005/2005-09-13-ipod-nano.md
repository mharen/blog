My friend Bryan did a [quick analysis](http://guybehindtheguy.blogspot.com/2005/09/is-that-ipod-nano-in-your-pocket-or.html) of this [tiny, little device](http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/). I completely agree with his conclusion regarding color choices: what happened? Like Tif, My wife agrees that the mini is soooo "I want one" because of the color choices. As it stands now, your only options are white and red (U2). Wow it's small, though.

Check out [Bryan's article](http://guybehindtheguy.blogspot.com/2005/09/is-that-ipod-nano-in-your-pocket-or.html) for some more commentary and references.

I find the [iPod](http://www.apple.com/ipod/) pricing structure devilishly clever. It kills me:



|Model|Size (GB)|Cost|$/GB|
|-|-|-|-|
|Shuffle|0.5|$99|$198|
|Shuffle|1|$129|$129|
|Nano|2|$199|$100|
|Nano|4|$249|$62|
|Mini (disc.)|4|$199|$50|
|Mini (disc.)|6|$249|$42|
|iPod|20|$299|$15|
|iPod|60|$399|$7|

Let's ignore that last column for now ($/GB). We'll work our way down. Suppose you are interested in a Shuffle. You get double the songs for a mere $30 more. That's a tough upgrade to ignore unless you really lock into the first model being sub-$100. Don't worry, it gets worse.

Suppose you were interested in a Nano. Starting at $199, you are damn close to a full blown iPod. For a mere $100, you get ten times the space! Ok, ok so space is important to you but not *that* important? So you move up to the larger Nano (4 GB). Whoops, now you're only $50 away from the real dealâ€”might as well upgrade right now. We had basically the same problem with the Mini that this model replaced.

Tomorrow I'll discuss a few ways you can talk yourself out of (or maybe into) these upgrades.
