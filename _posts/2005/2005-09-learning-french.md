title: Learning French
---

On my recent journey to Canada (work, don't ask), I took it upon myself to learn French. Audiotapes? No. Workbooks? No. Full Submersion? No. Street signs? No. Oh wait, yeah, street signs. For much of the way through Canada, the highway signs came in pairs: the first in English and the second in French.

Using a few signs as my [Rosetta Stone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_stone) I now consider myself a fluent speaker. Here's what I've learned so far...

<h3>Metric Conversion</h3>

Let's start with an easy one:


<div class="compare">![DSCF1244.jpg](DSCF1244.jpg)
<div class="compare">![>	<li value=](>	<li value=)
<div class="compare">![>	<li value=](>	<li value=)Awesome, now I have a fluent vocabulary of 17 words. My next challenge is to communicate with others using only these words.  Feel free to submit your suggested sentences as a comment.
