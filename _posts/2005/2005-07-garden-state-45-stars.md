I must admit that I was a little hesitant to see [this one](http://imdb.com/title/tt0333766/). I really like [Zak Braff](http://imdb.com/name/nm0103785/) on scrubs and [Natalie Portman's](http://imdb.com/name/nm0000204/) been cool since she played the preteen assassin in [LÃ©on](http://imdb.com/title/tt0110413/) so I gave it a go. By the way, did you know that she was born in Jerusalem, Israel? At least according to imdb.

I really liked it. I thought it moved along a little slowly at times but overall, I felt it to be pretty true-to-life.  I connected with the characters on some levels (certainly not too many ;)) and really seemed to understand where they were coming from.

I'm new to this movie reviewing thing so this is as good as it gets as I'm the first to admit, I'm not a professional critic. If you have any titles you'd recommend, drop me an [email](mailto:michael@wassupy.com) or post a comment.
