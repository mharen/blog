Hi all :)

I ran in the Race for the Cure last weekend, a 5k road race in Columbus intended to raise money for breast cancer research.

I did better than I had expected - 24:06 (~8 min/mile), placing 33rd in my age group, out of 988 women ages 20-29 :)  Last year I placed 155th (out of 983).

Over 26,000 people participated!

I had a great time - running with 26,000 other people is a very cool feeling.  Michael has told me that he'll run in a 5k with me once we move to North Carolina...yay!

If anyone is interested in running in the Race for the Cure next year (in May sometime) let me know and we can try to get a group together - I'll come back to Columbus for it :)

Until then 

- Sarah
