title: Check Out This Hot Dog
---

If all goes smoothly, this may be our new friend!:


<div style="text-align: center;">![carl.jpg](carl.jpg)He is a four-month old beagle/basset hound. We've spent a fair amount of time with him at the [SPCA](http://www.spcawake.org) and really like him. If our application comes through and the timing works out, we will be all set.

Now all we need is a name! We have several ideas, including:<ul>

	<li>Carl</li>

	<li>Hendrix</li>

	<li>Gordon</li>

	<li>Sam</li>

	<li>Pirate</li>

	<li>Napoleon</li>

</ul>

My personal favorite has got to be Pirate. Just imagine the scenarios...



<blockquote>> "Oh he's so cute, what's his name!?"

< "Pirate."

> "Oh...um...oh."

> "Hi...pirate."

< "Yarrrr!"</blockquote>

Feel free to submit any ideas as a comment--we are open to suggestions. We were pretty set on Charlie Brown but that was vetoed because we found it was used by another family member's dog.
