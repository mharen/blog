title: Check Out This Hot Dog
---

If all goes smoothly, this may be our new friend!:


He is a four-month old beagle/basset hound. We've spent a fair amount of time with him at the [SPCA](http://www.spcawake.org) and really like him. If our application comes through and the timing works out, we will be all set.

Now all we need is a name! We have several ideas, including:

	* Carl
	* Hendrix
	* Gordon
	* Sam
	* Pirate
	* Napoleon

My personal favorite has got to be Pirate. Just imagine the scenarios...

> "Oh he's so cute, what's his name!?"
> 
> "Pirate."
> 
> "Oh...um...oh."
> 
> "Hi...pirate."
> 
> "Yarrrr!"

We were pretty set on Charlie Brown but that was vetoed because we found it was used by another family member's dog.
