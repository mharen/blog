title: Impatience at its best
---

While waiting in line on one of Cary's main roads a few days ago I was presented with a fine display of impatience. Let me set the scene for you. We're all waiting at a traffic light that has a left-turn lane. There is no one in the lane and the cars going straight at backed up so far that if someone DID want to turn right, they'd have to wait to get closer--to the point where the lane begins.

While I admit this would be a little annoying it certainly doesn't justify using your SUV to drive onto the cement median with all four wheels for a significant distance only to wait in the turn lane for the light to change. Is that what we've come to? I'd be pissed, too, if I didn't get any use out of my trail-rated vehicle--what with all the off roading I do in my family transport--but take it out on the environment like everyone else. Thanks for doing your part to keep gasoline prices up there (can you say supply/**demand**?).
