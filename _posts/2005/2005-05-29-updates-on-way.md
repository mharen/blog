I've got a lot to write about but it's going to have to wait just a little while longer. I've got a final test and a final project due this week and a whole slew of finals next week...

Anyway, things to write about...

* moving/packing
* ~~hockey (GAME TONIGHT at 11:15! We're in the finals!)~~ (6/1/05)
* ~~Graduation~~ (6/2/05)
* perl and php
* Damon's
* ~~7th Heaven and other things evil~~ (5/31/05)
* ~~24 Season Finale~~ (5/31/05)
* ~~Alias Season Finale (OMG)~~ (5/31/05)
* ~~Lost Season Finale~~ (6/2/05)
* Ike (the hampster)
* ~~Sofa Express~~ (6/6/05)
* etc.

So you see, I have been busy, just not talking about it.
