I'm planning a poker tourney for Friday 3/4/05. It'll start aroud 8-8:30 and probably run until around midnight. I'm hoping to get 2 tables going. If you are interested, please let me know so I can plan accordingly. If you've never played, never fear! It's fun and easy to learn. At $5, it's cheaper than a movie ;). The usual snacks, soda, beer, etc. will be available.

I'm also considering allowing 'rebuys' for the first hour or so. Has anyone played a tourney with rebuys before? How'd it go?

Again, if you are the slightest bit interested, drop me an email or give me a call and we can talk about it.
