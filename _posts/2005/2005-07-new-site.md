If you've been here before, you no doubt have noticed that things are now completely different. I've dropped the custom blogging stuff that I wrote for this spiffy application. I'm a big fan of rolling my own software but it's hard to resist free software that is so well supported.

I managed to import pretty much everything from my old blog with one big exception: photos. I still have my [photo gallery](gallery2/) but all my imbeded pictures are gone. How's that for a backup plan? Oh well--you live, you learn.
