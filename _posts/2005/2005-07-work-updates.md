Iâ€™m working out of my home office, telecommuting to the Aurora, Ohio office. Itâ€™s pretty neat and the hours are very flexible. You wouldnâ€™t believe the morning traffic, though. Sometimes the fourteen feet I must travel to find my desk are total gridlock.

The plan is to have an office in the area â€œsoon.â€ Iâ€™ll let you know when I know ïŠ.

Presently Iâ€™m working on a bunch of software for a big project. I donâ€™t really know if Iâ€™m allowed to talk about it so I wonâ€™t. Itâ€™s not hush-hush or anything, Iâ€™m just being extra careful my first few months until I get a good feel for what is appropriate and what is not. Besides, why bore you with the details?
