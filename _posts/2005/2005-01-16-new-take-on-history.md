title: a new take on history
---

My Grandmother passed away last week. Don't feel bad - I didn't know her. I, to little suprise, didn't know her first name. It's a long story so you'll just have to take my word for it that there're good reasons behind the distance.

Anyhow, we went up today to clean up the house and go through everything. I felt like I was in a museum. It was pretty neat, actually. She had books from the 1800s; Sarah found a bible dated circa 1850. I found a geography book that excludes Hawaii and Alaska from the US, a reference book that only covers presidents up to Woodrow Wilson, and a world map that's missing all of today's warring nations. This is crazy! I found the original issue of Life magazine dated Aug. 8, 1969, covering the original lunar landing. That's 14 years + 1 day before sarah was born.

Sarah also happened upon a Chemistry book that shows only 92 elements--20 short of today's count.

More updates later. I hope to take some pictures when I go up next weekend and deal with the 4000 Reader's Digests she's got hidden away.
