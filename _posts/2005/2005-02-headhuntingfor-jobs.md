I went to a career fair today. No funnel cakes or carnival rides, just 90-seconds interviews. I talked with a bunch of companies (RoviSys, IBM, Bosch, Ball, Harris, etc.) and received a pretty standard response: go to the website and upload a resume. I made 20 copies of the damn thing on 'resume paper' and only was able to deliver 3 of them. Oy! 

If anyone's looking for a computer engineer to start work in June 2005, in North Carolina, let me know.
