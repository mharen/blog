title: Poseidon Swimming System
---

Now [this](http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/08/31/1628210&tid=126&tid=14) is damn cool. The [Poseidon Swimming System](http://www.poseidon-tech.com/us/components.html) is a computer imaging system used to detect when someone is drowning. Effectively, it tracks swimmers and sounds an alert to screens, sirens, pagers, etc. when a swimmer stops moving. How cool! This is an awesome application of imaging technologyâ€”a field that typically only receives publicity for its security implications.

You might also be surprised to hear that this product has been around for several years.
