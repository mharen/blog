title: How to easily install miniblinds

If you have ever installed miniblinds, good for you. I recently moved into a new home and had a hell of a time getting these things installed. Considering myself relatively handy with a power tool I found this odd.

Further investigation revealed that the problem was with the window frame. You see, my windows are surrounded by a nice sharp edge. To create this edge, the builder uses a metal strip on the corner (drywall edges are not so nice). The problem is that the crummy screws you get with the blinds are nearly immpossible to get *through* this metal strip.

The solution, while obvious now, wasn't for the first few windows...

You can either use a drill to poke through the metal or just a nail. The nail has the added benefit of holding the bracket in place so that you can similtaneously create a second hole while still keeping things lined up. Obviously, it helps to choose a nail that is a little narrower than the screws you will be using ;).

Super simple, huh?
