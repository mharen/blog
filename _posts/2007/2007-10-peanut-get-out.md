title: Peanut, GET OUT!
---

So I'm officially 2 days past my due date.  Definitely not gonna get me a world record, but come on, Peanut!  There are people waiting to meet you!

I've decided she's either:

a. Lazy

b. Stubborn

c. Both

At least if she's both, she'll have gotten characteristics of both Michael and I (I'll let you decide which is which...not that it's difficult :)).
