title: Still Here, Still Pregnant
---

Today is officially my due date, and I'm still pregnant :P  No contractions, no progress in at least 4 weeks despite many attempts to encourage Peanut's evacuation (including eating lots of pineapple, taking lots of walks, running on a treadmill, driving down a bumpy road, cleaning cleaning cleaning, moving boxes, etc.) but no such luck.  I'm hoping she just wants to come ON her due date, but I'm not trying to get too excited about it.  We will definitely post when she's on her way (or at least when she gets here, depending on how crazy it is!).  Looks like I'm having an October baby :P
